The way Nicki says the words, they flow so smoothly. She\'s such a lyrical genius it\'s insane. Also, the lyrics themselves are so good. The effects are amazing, such as the ringing bell and the horn. The instruments are amazing, the "ting" of the cymbals, the trumpet, percussion projecting her words, the beat, the synthesizer, and the clapping too. It\'s so good. The saying "hey" and "damn" in the background is such a good touch to the piece as well. The storytelling is amazing, the song has been viewed by some as a diss track, in answer to "Baby Got Back". Whereas Sir Mix-a-Lot focuses on a woman\'s body and the pleasure it gives him, Minaj raps from the perspective of the unnamed woman and shows how she uses her body to profit and empower herself. It\'s so different from some of her other, newer songs too, such as BANG and Super Freaky Girl, which are both SUPER GOOD, but I just love how this song differentiates from others. It\'s also very different from some other female singers, such as Selena Gomez or Arianna Grande, which is cool too. She\'s just so different with storytelling and music, especially in this piece of music. Also,  the song peaked at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming Minaj\'s highest-charting single at the time. The song also peaked within the top ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, the top forty in Austria, France, and Portugal, and the top fifty in the Czech Republic. Also, the art and photography of the cover are great as well, it\'s simplistic and not too provocative, but also doesn\'t take away from Nicki\'s more "PG-13" style of music.', 'd1 level glazing', 'is this a copypasta?', 'NOTHING BUT FACTS', 'She\'s such a lyrical genius it\'s insane.\n\n"I\'ve got a big fat ass"', 'Soy fan del Pop/rock pero esta Mujer si es un talento para la música Urbana 🔥🔥', 'Onika Maraj is my girlfriend and we copulate.\r\nHer relationship with that criminal is only for public consumption.', '\u200b@MdoubleHBWhat the hell?', '*twerking aggressively*', 'Oh Hi blink🖤💗', 'Hello Army💜', 'Wow u copied my comment i made 3 months ago and got 1 like, you made this in a day and you recived 147 likes.. how', 'Lol', 'barbz and blinks!!', 'It’s crazy how pretty much every single one of Nicki Minaj’s songs are practically our entire childhood', 'wow u must have had such a bad childhood', '@Arya Araokar no I actually didn’t because songs like these I recognize from when I was a kid cause I listened to those songs a lot as a kid', '@garrett griffith how old r u', '@DaKneezBeez id rather not say not to be rude or nothin but I just don’t really wanna share personal stuff', "There won't be any other Nicki Minaj in the industry there won't be any other Anaconda in history...8 years but still a hit🔥🔥💕", 'Its crazy that its already 8 years i remember hearing it in the radio when it was new', '@Sebastian Andrup yeah💖✌️no Grammy but Still  a GOAT though💕✌️', 'Drake whispered in nicki\'s hear.."you dont have to do this."', 'Damn I totally forgot about that it has been 8 years since it came out', 'não se encontra talentos como esse hj em dia. rainhaaaa', 'Escuto esse hino todo os dias 🥺🙏🙏', 'kkk', 'Same', 'Um hino amo', '❤', "The world wasn't ready when this song came out..", 'True', 'Facts bruh those good ol days', 'Lol', 'For real', 'Essa música anaconda sempre será um marco pro rap feminino nicki minaj rainha do rap ❤ 🇧🇷', 'Simmmm', 'sim, mas ainda prefiro cardi b', '@Henrique Almeida cada um tem seu gosto.

I feel like a Monday, even though it's a Friday and the hospital is closed. This Pokemon appears in swarms outside my window whenever I close my eyes, I swear to you though, the very moment I open them, she's gone like the wind. Like my eyes were playing tricks on me, this Pokemon evades my gaze. It's there, though. I've spent weeks without sleep, just staring at the window in avid anticipation for Pheromosa's appearance, yet every time I blink, she arrives, and once my eyes are open again, she is gone. Life is short, and yet so long. At one point, I brought a camera, some tape, and a bowling pin, but still couldn't get any images of her, I can't tell if she evaded the camera as it shuttered, or if perhaps she decided not to arrive at all. All I know is that this Pokemon, which I would call a 'slam dunk' is around me at all times.

Pheromosa is very hot, in an elegant way, definitely my number 2 personally, however, I would like to voice a grievance I have with this listing site... My number one sexiest pokemon (Leavanny) is not an option on this list website. You are all fools, utter utter fools. To think, a pokemon as sexy as Leavanny is not even considered as an option on this website?! Absurd! This is a spit in the face of any true pokénut lovers and I will get you for this! I will not, however, submit her myself as I cannot be bothered but rest assured I'll get my revenge  Thin people are not attractive to very large numbers of people. But this does not mean that people with such addictions to thin creatures do not exist. Pheromosa is a great example of this type of sexuality in Pokémon.

Our original plan was to just get bevved, but one thing led to another and I ended up taking some lass home. I walked through the front door with the girl and looked into the kitchen. I saw a plate left on the table with tin foil covering it. "Oh, did you make some food to eat when you got home?" the girl asked. "No, I didn\'t. I think mummy must have left this for me," I replied. I walked over and lifted the tin foil. It was a plate of turkey dinosaurs and potato smiles ready to be reheated. Nice. I took the girl upstairs towards my room. "Now stay quiet, daddy has enough trouble sleeping with mummy\'s CPAP machine going all night. She has really bad sleep apnea," I warned. The girl nodded and quickly tiptoed with me past their bedroom door. When we got into my dark room, the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling were the first to draw the eye. I always thought space was cool and I\'d hope any girl worth my time would think the same. I then turned the light on so she didn\'t trip over my Power Rangers figures I had been playing with before I left. I saw here staring at my PC below my Danny Phantom poster. "Yeah, I\'ve got a 3080 in there, but the whole thing is a custom build so I could fit the components into the Hot Wheels case. It\'s the same setup that I had as a kid and I\'m not ready to let go just yet." She remained quiet but I assume she was impressed. I pushed her down onto my Lightning McQueen bed and tore off her clothes. I threw her pants behind me and they landed on my Dragon Ball figurine shelf. I took my trousers off but quickly emptied the pockets so I didn\'t leave a used tissue in them and ruin another wash. Mummy really needs to start checking herself before she puts them in the machine. We started to plow but it was difficult to thrust back without hitting my feet into the back of McQueen\'s face. I persisted though. I was riding a girl like my favourite race car. I could tell she was about to cum so I increased my speed. You\'ve always got to be fastest at the finish line. Her eyes rolled back and at the point of climax I uttered one word. "Kachow." I rolled off her onto the floor as there wasn\'t enough room on the bed to fit two people. I lifted my head up to face her. "You\'ve just had the Lightning experience. Only special girls get that, so feel proud."
