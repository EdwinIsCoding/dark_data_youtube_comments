"“ For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son , that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”-John 3:16  “Therefore, son of man, say to your people, ‘If someone who is righteous disobeys, that person’s former righteousness will count for nothing. And if someone who is wicked repents, that person’s former wickedness will not bring condemnation.” -Ezekiel 33:12  Trust in Christ and he will make his home in your hearts (Ephesians 3:17)  Repent while you still can.

Jiggly Puff is the worst character in the game. Super Smash Bro’s the same as well. Why would you use jiggly puff? The only good technique ( IT ) has is putting people to sleep. That’s it. If you watch DevilArtemis you will see in one of his videos Kermit beats the hell out of jiggly puff with a baseball bat to get him to evolve but never works. I never use a jiggly puff in Pokémon games as well that’s how bad jiggly puff is.,XiroMassave,0,2023-04-07T13:16:48Z
