I hear a lot of controversy about this kid I've never really cared for his music I do listen to a lot of drill rap but I'm not a fan of this kid but what I am a fan of and what I do think is fuckingawesome is the fact that you got a white kid making drill rap but he's not acting like a tough guy he's actually pointing out the fact that he's actually not that's awesome for once somebody is actually famous for wrapping and they're not trying to pretend like there's some hard-ass or something it shows kids that you don't have to be a tough guy to be cool or fit in or even make this type of music you don't have to be murderer or a killer you can just be yourself like I say I've heard of kid before but I've never listened to his songs I actually ended up listening to this song and watching the music video because my ten-year-old son asked me if I could play the song for him I will always promote my kids listening to music like this for sure and I made sure I pointed out the fact to my son that this kid is not trying to look or act tough or like a killer or drug dealer he's just a kid who wanted to get into drill 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯,James Mower,0,2023-06-21T22:40:26Z

"am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon.The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.",NotDeplu,2,2023-06-04T14:31:47Z

"Track is not bad by any stretch, and yeah it’s cool kid’s got a sense of humor and is finding a way to exploit what should be a hard pass into what’ll likely be mad lucrative for him (or like, more lucrative for his very heavily integrated family name in nyc, if you wanna be semi-petty)  But, I do gotta say if this shit is given the green light, then the entire drill scene shit you go and say even the whole rap game itself is “yeah nah I know in that song I said chop on my lap and I’ll shoot a cop no prob” or “fight me and see what happens” but irl this youngster has not never once been even remotely as tapped in on the real ass life or death type shit that rappers make songs about, and yeah a LOT of fools (now and even back then) were cap to one degree or another.  So TLDR; my question is, despite this kid saying he’ll slide your block but with his family business’s name, their bankroll, his 600k world famous Latin/Greek philosophy ass havin prep school watching him, does anyone here have a single worry in their hearts that lil mablu bustin shots out the window at you? Cuz I’d be willing to put money on the fact that it’s 0% chance (paying fools a bag to head hunt is different) look, long ass comment I know, I just like rap, especially shit that hits hard, and knowing this is being backed by actual street demons out there makes the whole scene seem like it’s cool to cosplay as a shooter when in reality kids got a 13mil family net 🤷‍♂️  Congrats to anyone who read all that. I just care about the integrity of rap culture (and I know, it’s not even my place to say shit really given my white as shit-ness) and I don’t see this shit helping that shit at all I see it turning into some shit you’ll see some 9 year old Korean girl start getting plays next n shit…",Jamie Speirs,0,2023-05-07T08:09:57Z

If Mabu is tapped in & cool with the bros Notti (rip… E4N🙏), JstarB n DD osama like that then I kinda can’t not fuck w the kid 🤷‍♂️ 
Last bit on this, fuck that dorky ass Matty jizz, man’s a full grown adult & made a song on bout child’s murder and how much he enjoyed it. That’s the corniest shit I ever seen, they was laughing on live cuz rumor was you died from overdose, and I watched that lil interview w marty D- or whatever his name is, and the fat fuck didn’t even have the nut sack to tell his interviewer why that happened. Dude just took too many “percs” (btw Matthew, that m30 don’t got no damn oxycodone in there cuh 😂 you just did too much fetty and had to have a emergency meeting with Narcan to wake ya ass up out from death. Marty g and his fans can try and deny it all they want, but he knows I’m right on that deep down. Get help and stop dissing minors who were killed, fuckin penguin look ass. Rest In Peace Notti, and to that whole fam I hope y’all get the closure deserved and catch that fool (the dude who couldn’t handle being hit with a broom, and mattys dumbass) lackin.

I highly doubt this dude even understands the street code which is really dangerous. People living the street life are not your friends. Only the people who say ""I don't want to live like this anymore"" are your real friends. Someone's going to take advantage of this dude.

"made another version of this music:  Yo, let's take a trip to the hood Where the streets are rough and the folks are good Gonna see some things that you've never seen And live a life that's real, not just a dream  The block is hot, the corners crowded But that's where the real ones go, so don't be doubting Got my boys with me, we're ready for whatever Making moves in the streets, we're birds of a feather  We hit the corner store for some snacks and brews Gotta keep our energy up for the things we're gonna do Got some dice in our hands, ready for some gambling Got some girls on our arms, this night's gonna be a rambling  The music's blasting, the bass is pumping The people are jumping, we're all just thumping This is where we belong, in the heart of the city Living life on the edge, it's gritty but pretty  The night is young, the stars are bright We're living life to the fullest, we're doing it right So come on, let's take a trip to the hood Where the streets are rough and the folks are good",yRobloxianoBR,0,2023-04-20T01:31:53Z

This kid obviously has connection (family members)with in the Law/justice system/government, it's the only reason he's able to move like that. You don't gotta go to the hood to make it happen on your own aint no type of opportunitys in the hood, but one and that's school.

"After a couple of listens, I'm starting to realize this guy might be a genius. Or at least smarter than we all think. This whole production was incredibly well put together. Not only that, but his acting skills are really good. His tone of voice, the small mannerisms, facial expressions, and confidence on camera makes it feel like he was very intentional with how he wanted to portray himself. I found the irony behind the contrast of his suburban character and hard hitting type music to be hilarious. It was funny without being corny, and that's because his musical ability is impressive and enjoyable to listen to. It's the perfect recipe for a viral sensation. And the effort he put forth, I think, is underappreciated.",Financial Charles,4742,2023-04-17T02:10:23Z
He was funded by his dad and he’s not a real gangster he’s not about that life or was and he’s stealing king vons flow and it’s disrespectful to the hip hop community and rappers who did have to go through those struggles and it’s a hard life he ain’t ever seen that or lived it and I just hope he’s safe because when your a rapper what you rap about will come back eventually somebody’s gonna check him or something I hope not because me personally idk why you would portray yourself in that light when your already comfortable because there are rappers who are very much about that life and that code and the street code doenst really like fake gangsters,Gassedshaggy,0,2023-07-17T07:55:50Z

"I’m not hating I’m just gonna say this as it is relative to hip hop history. There is no respect in the game for a white rapper. Hip Hop is was a movement in the black community that was essentially a vessel to make art and conscious work for blacks to speak on the injustices and disparities of growing up in a compromised area void of many opportunities. This is the epitome of what a culture vulture is and it’s really a shame because black history is getting erased left and right like it wasnt here in the first place. Mos def even said people ask where is hip hop going? Well, this is it folks. This isn’t even talent these are nursery rhymes my 14 year old sister can write.",Prank Star,1,2023-03-30T15:47:35Z

"@Congus fair point, you’re right about almost everything, genius might be too much lmaoo, but i was just acknowledging that hey this kids music isn’t too bad, and the reference in the beginning was clever. all that other shit about being braindead and hyping him up idk about.",deathwish,0,2023-05-25T22:56:05Z
"Also so much meaning, like the way every word affects the meaning of the line it’s in and then the same for the next following line. The way the whole song fits together to show a perspective or send a message or just even to get the listener to think, he’s so talented. But his flow tho, every line is like hearing the rap as an instrument to the song.  So many layers and not repetitive and stale for 2 and a half minutes straight. The craftsmanship is actually very bare bones, I’ve been trying to see what all y’all are seeing but this guy has nothing special in his music, no meaningful lyrics, generic beat, generic flow. This is NPC music, like crap that an AI would make to try to stimulate human music, all music theory but no soul. Y’all just supporting the upcoming of a younger 69 my guys. Y’all actually braindead for hyping this as much as you are.",Congus,0,2023-05-25T11:03:15Z

"jokes aside i went a high school that had a bunch of trust funded wannabe gangster kids trying to act good and sell drugs and flex guns where they had no business doing so. A couple of them ended up dying of drug addiction and a few ended up locked up right after high school. people who grew up with everything handed to them, living in rich ass suburbs, gated communities, they see gang life as a way to look cool and hard, likes it’s just some type of style or mask you put on.

"If you die tonight, do you know where you're going? Did you know that Jesus Christ is THE Truth, the life and the only way to Heaven? 
Revelation 20:15 ''Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.''
Through Jesus Christ, God offers you a FREE gift – forgiveness. All you need to do is repent, turn away from your sins and evil ways, 
from now on put your faith completely in Jesus Christ and be obedient to Him.

Biblical explanation of the Gospel:

God doesn’t want anybody in hell, but you must understand why
we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go
there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but
rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). God gave us free will and since Adam
sinned in the garden, sin is the nature of our flesh and we ALL have sinned. (Romans 3:23) 
The law demands death to those who sin (Romans 6:23). Since we have all sinned, we all deserve hell. 
Revelation 21:8 says that all liars will go to hell. Yes, even if you have lied once in your life, you are sentenced to hell - that's how
high God's standards are of moral perfection because God is holy and righteous, there is not one sin in Him.
For someone to be justified before holy God they have to be sinless, that's why everyone need Jesus Christ 
- for He lived a sinless life, died on the cross and rose from the dead on the third day.


None of us are good in God’s eyes, because for God good means moral perfection. We all
have broken God’s commandments, we all have sinned in our lives so none of us
are good. ‘’For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is
guilty of breaking all of it.’’ (James 2:10). Our carnal mind is hostile to God; it does not submit
to God's moral law and it never will (Romans 8:7). We hate the thought of God for the same reason a criminal
hates a policeman - we know we have sinned against God and are guilty of it and we don't want to be damned.
No good works will ever save you. You can't earn salvation by good works, because God will judge us for our sin.

Good News is that Jesus Christ lived a perfect, holy, sinless life and He died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 
He was buried and He was raised from the dead on the third day according to the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)
For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever
believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.’’ (John 3:16) 
We aren’t saved by our good works, but only by the grace of God through faith in Christ. 
''For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -
not by works, so that no one can boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9) 
Jesus said ‘’it is finished’’ (John 19:30) just before He died on the cross, which means He paid the fine for our sins
(past, present, future) to be forgiven only IF we repent and trust in Him.

This is how you can get saved from sin and hell - repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ. Get to know Him
by reading God's Word.
So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.” (Luke 11:13)


''What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!'' (Romans 6:15)
''Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out'' (Acts 3:19)
Repentance is a turning away from sin and all evil works, and it always results in changed behavior (Luke 3:8). 
Biblically, a person who repents does not continue willfully in sin.
While sorrow from sin is not equivalent to repentance, it is certainly an element of scriptural repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10). 
Do not play a hypocrite. ''God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all. 
If we claim to have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.'' (1 John 1:5-6)


(John 3:3) Jesus replied, ""Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again."" 
If you have repented and have genuine faith in Jesus Christ then you will receive the gift of Holy Spirit and be born-again spiritually. 
When you believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance 
until the redemption of those who are God’s possession - to the praise of His glory. (Ephesians 1:13-14)

Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (John 3:36)


''You will know them by their fruits'' (Matthew 7)
If you have been truly born-again with the Holy Spirit and He has regenerated your heart, you will desire righteousnes - 
to do what is good and righteous in God's eyes, to seek God everyday in His Word and prayer, to strengthen your relationship with God.
You will no longer desire to willfully continue living in sin but will want to obey God out of your love for Him because of His amazing grace
revealed to us through the death and resurrection of His Son.
''Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.'' (2 Corinthians 5:17)
''For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.'' (Eph 2:10)
You will have a testimony - of what your life had been before and how has it changed now when you have surrendered it to Lord Jesus Christ.


As a declaration and affirmation of your faith in Jesus Christ, get baptised in water because He commanded us to do so.
In John 3:5 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.''
''Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'' (Matthew 28:19)
''Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.'' (Acts 2:41)
''And this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also - not the removal of dirt from the body, 
but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God - through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,'' (1 Peter 3:21)
''We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, 
just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.'' (Romans 6:4)
''Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, 
who raised him from the dead.'' (Colossians 2:12)


Please get right with God and get to know Jesus Christ personally today before it’s too late, because there’s not much time left! 
""But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.’’ (Mark 13:32)
Get to know Christ through God's Word - Bible. At first I recommend reading Gospel of John and book of Romans. God bless you!

"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young woman. Thank you.",zeroゼロ,11,2023-03-14T20:57:52Z

WE MAKING IT OUT OF OUR MIDDLE CLASS MEDIUM SIZED HOUSE AND INTO POVERTY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🥶,OldPets 2,35,2023-03-12T10:15:20Z
"If you die tonight, do you know where you're going? Did you know that Jesus Christ is THE Truth, the life and the only way to Heaven? 
Revelation 20:15 ''Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.''
Through Jesus Christ, God offers you a FREE gift – forgiveness. All you need to do is repent, turn away from your sins and evil ways, 
from now on put your faith completely in Jesus Christ and be obedient to Him.

Biblical explanation of the Gospel:

God doesn’t want anybody in hell, but you must understand why
we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go
there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but
rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). God gave us free will and since Adam
sinned in the garden, sin is the nature of our flesh and we ALL have sinned. (Romans 3:23) 
The law demands death to those who sin (Romans 6:23). Since we have all sinned, we all deserve hell. 
Revelation 21:8 says that all liars will go to hell. Yes, even if you have lied once in your life, you are sentenced to hell - that's how
high God's standards are of moral perfection because God is holy and righteous, there is not one sin in Him.
For someone to be justified before holy God they have to be sinless, that's why everyone need Jesus Christ 
- for He lived a sinless life, died on the cross and rose from the dead on the third day.


None of us are good in God’s eyes, because for God good means moral perfection. We all
have broken God’s commandments, we all have sinned in our lives so none of us
are good. ‘’For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is
guilty of breaking all of it.’’ (James 2:10). Our carnal mind is hostile to God; it does not submit
to God's moral law and it never will (Romans 8:7). We hate the thought of God for the same reason a criminal
hates a policeman - we know we have sinned against God and are guilty of it and we don't want to be damned.
No good works will ever save you. You can't earn salvation by good works, because God will judge us for our sin.

Good News is that Jesus Christ lived a perfect, holy, sinless life and He died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 
He was buried and He was raised from the dead on the third day according to the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)
For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever
believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.’’ (John 3:16) 
We aren’t saved by our good works, but only by the grace of God through faith in Christ. 
''For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -
not by works, so that no one can boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9) 
Jesus said ‘’it is finished’’ (John 19:30) just before He died on the cross, which means He paid the fine for our sins
(past, present, future) to be forgiven only IF we repent and trust in Him.

This is how you can get saved from sin and hell - repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ. Get to know Him
by reading God's Word.
So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.” (Luke 11:13)


''What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!'' (Romans 6:15)
''Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out'' (Acts 3:19)
Repentance is a turning away from sin and all evil works, and it always results in changed behavior (Luke 3:8). 
Biblically, a person who repents does not continue willfully in sin.
While sorrow from sin is not equivalent to repentance, it is certainly an element of scriptural repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10). 
Do not play a hypocrite. ''God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all. 
If we claim to have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.'' (1 John 1:5-6)


(John 3:3) Jesus replied, ""Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again."" 
If you have repented and have genuine faith in Jesus Christ then you will receive the gift of Holy Spirit and be born-again spiritually. 
When you believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance 
until the redemption of those who are God’s possession - to the praise of His glory. (Ephesians 1:13-14)

Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (John 3:36)


''You will know them by their fruits'' (Matthew 7)
If you have been truly born-again with the Holy Spirit and He has regenerated your heart, you will desire righteousnes - 
to do what is good and righteous in God's eyes, to seek God everyday in His Word and prayer, to strengthen your relationship with God.
You will no longer desire to willfully continue living in sin but will want to obey God out of your love for Him because of His amazing grace
revealed to us through the death and resurrection of His Son.
''Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.'' (2 Corinthians 5:17)
''For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.'' (Eph 2:10)
You will have a testimony - of what your life had been before and how has it changed now when you have surrendered it to Lord Jesus Christ.


As a declaration and affirmation of your faith in Jesus Christ, get baptised in water because He commanded us to do so.
In John 3:5 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.''
''Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'' (Matthew 28:19)
''Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.'' (Acts 2:41)
''And this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also - not the removal of dirt from the body, 
but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God - through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,'' (1 Peter 3:21)
''We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, 
just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.'' (Romans 6:4)
''Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, 
who raised him from the dead.'' (Colossians 2:12)


Please get right with God and get to know Jesus Christ personally today before it’s too late, because there’s not much time left! 
""But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.’’ (Mark 13:32)
Get to know Christ through God's Word - Bible. At first I recommend reading Gospel of John and book of Romans. God bless you!

"John 3:16 KJV  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.   1 Corinthians 15 :1-4 KJV  1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  Romans 3:23-25 KJV  23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:  25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;  Acts 20:28 KJV  28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.

"We are robbers, liars, adulterers, sinners, when we go to the court, the only way to pay for what we did is to go to prison (you can’t do good deeds to repay the bad you’ve already done, you have to face the consequences of your actions), if our sin was done against a policeman, the time spent in prison will be higher; judge higher, president; higher, the punishment against God is eternal prison, but if we have someone that will pay our debt we will be set free and this person is Jesus Christ. If you accept in your heart that He died for your sins, today, you will be saved and you’ll never be able to lose your salvation.",Dizy,0,2023-03-01T17:16:31Z

"i get it. its a good song. but being a rich kid from a nice neighborhood doesnt mean your parents just give you money. i know plenty of people whos parents are rich and they dont give much to their kids. sure, they can stay at a nice house and will most likely have food and be safer but they dont give you any more money. maybe 100 bucks here and there not much more than what someone who makes working in the hood would get.",Daniel Windsor Harman,0,2023-02-28T01:57:45Z

"@Blingah I agree with you on that, I still think it's bizarre how some people are actually mad that this kid isn't about that nasty violent street life, as if that life is something to be proud of, and as if not being part of that lifestyle means you cannot rap... People are obsessed with image, branding, sales, etc.. What happened to the love for music.
It's art at the end of the day, and art has no boundaries.",Anglo Kiwi,0,2023-02-26T10:55:16Z
"@Blingah he’s never claimed to have the same “experiences” outside of his music do have proof he’s 100% serious? It’s a running joke that he pretends about it, furthermore there’s plenty of black artist/celebrities that have 100% claimed it and said it’s true. But let’s get back to my previous questions, wheres your proof white people making music has lead to you points? Funny thing is I alr know you don’t have proof because if you did you’d have said it and being black myself Ik that assigning blame to a white kid for all the bs is just a sad attempt to avoid the true reasons behind it all",Calamity,0,2023-02-25T15:32:00Z

"@Calamity i know your young brain is still developing and reading may be hard for you. I never said this kid is responsible for the death and destruction of our community, thats common sense.

This kid comes from a stable good home. Hes portraying himself as a gangster, rappin about the hood, guns, opps he knows nothing about that life. While people that are born into these hood communites are dying, this fancy pants kid comes in rappin about nothing he has ever lived and is making money 💴",Blingah,0,2023-02-25T15:00:14Z

"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",John Pearson,0,2023-02-24T17:49:34Z

WE GOING TO BE DIDDLING DADDLING OUR WAY THROUGH THE HOOD WITH THIS ONE 🔥⚡️,Sahil Chowdhury,1042,2023-02-24T12:41:02Z
"If you die tonight, do you know where you're going? Did you know that Jesus Christ is THE Truth, the life and the only way to Heaven? 
Revelation 20:15 ''Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.''
Through Jesus Christ, God offers you a FREE gift – forgiveness. All you need to do is repent, turn away from your sins and evil ways, 
from now on put your faith completely in Jesus Christ and be obedient to Him.

Biblical explanation of the Gospel:

God doesn’t want anybody in hell, but you must understand why
we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go
there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but
rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). God gave us free will and since Adam
sinned in the garden, sin is the nature of our flesh and we ALL have sinned. (Romans 3:23) 
The law demands death to those who sin (Romans 6:23). Since we have all sinned, we all deserve hell. 
Revelation 21:8 says that all liars will go to hell. Yes, even if you have lied once in your life, you are sentenced to hell - that's how
high God's standards are of moral perfection because God is holy and righteous, there is not one sin in Him.
For someone to be justified before holy God they have to be sinless, that's why everyone need Jesus Christ 
- for He lived a sinless life, died on the cross and rose from the dead on the third day.


None of us are good in God’s eyes, because for God good means moral perfection. We all
have broken God’s commandments, we all have sinned in our lives so none of us
are good. ‘’For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is
guilty of breaking all of it.’’ (James 2:10). Our carnal mind is hostile to God; it does not submit
to God's moral law and it never will (Romans 8:7). We hate the thought of God for the same reason a criminal
hates a policeman - we know we have sinned against God and are guilty of it and we don't want to be damned.
No good works will ever save you. You can't earn salvation by good works, because God will judge us for our sin.

Good News is that Jesus Christ lived a perfect, holy, sinless life and He died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 
He was buried and He was raised from the dead on the third day according to the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)
For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever
believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.’’ (John 3:16) 
We aren’t saved by our good works, but only by the grace of God through faith in Christ. 
''For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith - and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God -
not by works, so that no one can boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9) 
Jesus said ‘’it is finished’’ (John 19:30) just before He died on the cross, which means He paid the fine for our sins
(past, present, future) to be forgiven only IF we repent and trust in Him.

This is how you can get saved from sin and hell - repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ. Get to know Him
by reading God's Word.
So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.” (Luke 11:13)


''What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!'' (Romans 6:15)
''Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out'' (Acts 3:19)
Repentance is a turning away from sin and all evil works, and it always results in changed behavior (Luke 3:8). 
Biblically, a person who repents does not continue willfully in sin.
While sorrow from sin is not equivalent to repentance, it is certainly an element of scriptural repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10). 
Do not play a hypocrite. ''God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all. 
If we claim to have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.'' (1 John 1:5-6)


(John 3:3) Jesus replied, ""Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again."" 
If you have repented and have genuine faith in Jesus Christ then you will receive the gift of Holy Spirit and be born-again spiritually. 
When you believed, you were marked in Him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance 
until the redemption of those who are God’s possession - to the praise of His glory. (Ephesians 1:13-14)

Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. (John 3:36)


''You will know them by their fruits'' (Matthew 7)
If you have been truly born-again with the Holy Spirit and He has regenerated your heart, you will desire righteousnes - 
to do what is good and righteous in God's eyes, to seek God everyday in His Word and prayer, to strengthen your relationship with God.
You will no longer desire to willfully continue living in sin but will want to obey God out of your love for Him because of His amazing grace
revealed to us through the death and resurrection of His Son.
''Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.'' (2 Corinthians 5:17)
''For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.'' (Eph 2:10)
You will have a testimony - of what your life had been before and how has it changed now when you have surrendered it to Lord Jesus Christ.


As a declaration and affirmation of your faith in Jesus Christ, get baptised in water because He commanded us to do so.
In John 3:5 Jesus answered, “Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.''
''Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'' (Matthew 28:19)
''Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.'' (Acts 2:41)
''And this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also - not the removal of dirt from the body, 
but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God - through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,'' (1 Peter 3:21)
''We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, 
just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.'' (Romans 6:4)
''Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of God, 
who raised him from the dead.'' (Colossians 2:12)


Please get right with God and get to know Jesus Christ personally today before it’s too late, because there’s not much time left! 
""But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.’’ (Mark 13:32)
Get to know Christ through God's Word - Bible. At first I recommend reading Gospel of John and book of Romans. God bless you!

"ONE TRIP GOD-JESUS Because of the long distance to the pickup point I like to limit my visits to the heap I put out my garbage on to one trip. Today I had four parcels and I prayed LORD how am I going to make one trip? (pan, box, bag, banana tree) I put the box and the bag atop the pan (upside down) on the tree branches and pulled them along – one trip! JESUS always has an answer and He made only one trip to the cross on Calvary for us for all past, present, and future sin. Give all your garbage to JESUS; He disposed of it all in just one trip.",Earl Green,1,2023-02-24T02:06:46Z

"""I took a trip to the hood so I can make it out"" is a comment on modern poverty that shows how the rich mock the poor by lowering themselves to their level and humiliating them. Just because lil Mabu is successful doesn't give him the right to mock those who have struggled and haven't made it out of the hood and are less successful to them. Lil Mabu uses his economic worth to mock and humiliate those of lesser means.",Daitobtw,1,2023-02-24T01:42:47Z
