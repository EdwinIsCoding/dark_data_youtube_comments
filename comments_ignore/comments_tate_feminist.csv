A man has a much harder time getting a women then the opposite so it’s not impressive when you do it. I think it’s not ok either way for a person to be promiscuous but for women it will make them less desirable to men for a slew of reasons. Remember women can only have one kid at a time. We have adapted over a relatively short span and the idea of a successful man wanting to pass on his genes as much as possible it’s a more recent idea of monogamy which I believe in. But nothing being said here isn’t true to me. But to each their own.,Throwbacks only,0,2023-08-02T13:46:38Z

"No respectable woman would allow a man to cheat on her based on the fact that he has money. Money is irrelevant, thats a prostitute. And if a man is openly cheating then his woman his woman will eventually also cheat on him, women can be very vindictive so if your a man who makes alot of money then your woman will tell you what u want to hear, to not loose her gravy train. But i guarantee she will eventually cheat when the perfect opportunity presents itself to where she is certain she will not get caught. Then she will cheat, relationships like he is talking about do not exist without constant lying from both parties. If someone is constantly hurting you emotionally by cheating but you rely on him for financial support then you will simply cheat to make yourself feel better eventually about the situation, Thats just how humans are, Its human nature, So this is a recipe for disaster.

"He is wrong. And I'll tell you why. The female in nature is designed to be promiscuous to select the best possible mate. The male knows this, which is why they have ways to combat this. Some male animals have spears on the genitals to scrape away other males sperm. Some male animals grow big to fight off the competition. Male Insects literally cling onto the female after procreation to ward away other males.  Females are made to be choosy & they will choose the best mate. This doesn't change just bcos we are sitting in 2023.   The issue with promiscuousity is human male egos. They seem to have an issue with females being desired. You are just acting in your natural animalistic behaviour by fighting away the other males. But in today's society, you do it with words and insults. You make your issues belong to every female. You make her feel that her natural instincts are wrong.   No sexual disease has ever sprung up from a female being promiscuous.",Caelia,0,2023-07-06T11:07:32Z

"@Jumped In The River What Did I See? But see that's the catch 22. The type of man that will wife up the town whore usually isn't the type of guy they want. They also have a hard time discerning between men wanting to sleep with them vs men wanting to wife them. Subtle but big difference. Women are having a hard time coming to terms with this.

"Problem is, he didn't say that men can do something just because they can. He gave logical reasons for that and even went on a 5 minute tirade about paternity issues and value. To add to that, men and women are different in terms of mating value. Men have to BUILD their value while a woman's job is to PRESERVE hers. She doesn't do that by giving away her body to 40+ dudes to have their way with.

Also, sex is easy for women to obtain so it's not respected. A girl can be a Lizzo and still get laid every Friday and have dudes line up to smash. For a man to be able to do that he has to be top notch. It's social proof that he has some kind of high value or status. An average guy can't be promiscuous. He's not going to have Instagram models lining up for him.",Imonous,0,2023-07-06T06:02:34Z

"Oh my god, Andrew Tate. I still have nightmares. We wanted to do good. We wanted to do right by the world. We wanted to make everyone equal. We were vain, we were egocentric. We thought that we should uplift animals like cats and dogs. We thought that we should give them human intelligence, because we thought that we should make everyone equal. To our credit, we didn’t try to uplift dogs or cats. We realized that they don’t have opposing thumbs and couldn’t affect the world like humans did.   So of course, we moved to Primates. Orang Utans, Gorillas, Shimpanzees. They had opposing thumbs. They were most like humans. So we chose to uplift them. So many died. But then, we were vindicated. Our first success, the former Shimpanzee, now given the name Andrew Tate, was a marvel. He could talk like a human. He could almost reason like a human. We gave him cars to drive around in, like those cute little parrots who drive around in these cute little bicycles. But of course, it was again our own hubris who made us think like that.   Andrew was a twisted thing, between human and Shimpanzee. An awesome fighter, like any Shimpanzee, but not a real one. Any Shimpanzee would destroy him in the physical department, and any human would destroy him in the mental department. So again, we tried to force our grand ideals on the world by turning him loose. Of course, he would find a way to benefit society, we would tell ourselves. Now I just want to apologize to the world and to Andrew. We did wrong by you!",Chris K.,0,2023-06-29T17:21:24Z

"OMG!  It’s frustrating that those women don't know how to respond to him, they even say I’m not a feminist! As it’s a bad word!!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️  First of all, we need to correct the misconception about feminism for those who misunderstand it. Feminism is not against men, it is not against religion, and it does not advocate nudity for women. Feminism simply demands power-sharing and decision-making in all fields with women, instead of it solely being in the hands of men.  Feminism does not deny biological differences, nor does it seek biological equality, as that is impossible. In the end, men cannot carry a child, and women do not possess the same muscular ability as men (unless trained). Additionally, feminism acknowledges that power has historically been in the hands of men.. and calls for men to share this power in order to achieve justice and amplify women's voices in all fields. Therefore, we cannot eliminate men, but we need to share responsibilities to achieve justice, and to make it easier even to the man.  When he mentioned that feminism cannot completely do away with men because women use phones made by men and drive cars made by men, firstly, that is true!  Neither women can do without men, nor men can do without women. Secondly, that is exactly what feminism advocates! It aims to enhance the role of women in inventions, discoveries, and entrepreneurship. When you say women use things created or invented by men, it means that in previous eras, power was primarily in the hands of men, which diminished the role of women in these inventions and hindered their contributions. Women were not even given the right to think. However, now we can clearly see successful women as inventors, discoverers, and business leaders due to the efforts of feminist movements in enhancing women's roles.  Regarding the point that women cannot defend themselves in wars, this is true because in most countries, women are not extensively trained in the military as men are. So it’s why that men have a greater ability to participate in wars, and women seek protection. Therefore, we also demand that women be trained to support men in wars. Ultimately, women are fully capable physically and mentally, and with intensive training, they can defend themselves and their countries.  I reiterate that feminism does not deny the biological differences between genders, but it only calls for justice in rights and duties.  It is enough to distort and diminish the value of these great efforts that have been made to defend and enhance women's position. Spreading misconceptions that feminism is against men and wants to completely do away with them contradicts logic altogether.",Nour Balbisi,0,2023-06-22T08:06:04Z

"Granted men are statistically physically stronger than women that is just basic biology due to testosterone but in reality how much hand to hand combat is used when fighting on a front line, train a woman to use a gun and they can shoot from afar the same way men on the frontline do. The stigma around the promiscuity of women compared to men is a sexist argument as old as time. Stop talking about the valuation of women like they have a price tag on them and look at them based on their attractive traits not just how many men they have slept with because if women did that to men like Andrew tate for example then he would have not slept with anyone after his 5th woman because anything more would “decrease his value”",songbird Singer,3,2023-06-01T17:16:30Z
Would also like to add that when he mentions girl’s having to defend their own education that those girls are exactly  that. Girls. Children. It’s not defending women it’s defending children. Also convenient that he forgets people like Malala yousafzi who literally got shot in the face for her education but I suppose it supports HIS side to forget that. Coincidence.

"Exactly, women can be trained to aim down the sights as much as men can Andy's embarassed himself there. And if anything when a man or woman is single, the fact that they COULD sleep with so many people is a testament to their attractiveness and confidence building which does nothing to ""decrease their value"".

Also, isn’t there proof of him being physically violent with his girlfriends/women in general?

Like police officers and soldiers?   Also this man is just so obnoxious in general.  My god.  He’s not smart - he just yells overtop of others so they can’t prove him wrong.

"Yes Andrew is so right. I'm not even anti-feminism, but what I cannot understand about the feminist's argument is that feminists tend to misunderstand that men and women should be able to do things equally.   As Andrew said, men never downgrade women when we say women are physically inferior to men. Men have its strengths and women has theirs. Men have its weakness and women have theirs. Men are thought to be incapable of multitasking compared to women. Women are mentally stronger, and many scientific researches proved that if men go through the pain of contraction when giving birth, men will die immediately. In addition, majority of women live longer than men in average.   Feminists only look at what they are inferior compared to men, and they do not actually realize in certain aspects how superior they are compared to men.   Women are suitable in field A, while men aren't. On the other hand, men are more suitable in field B while women aren't. This is the fundamental rule and system of the human history and society. It was made for men and women needing each other and compensating for each other's lack of ability.   Therefore, it is normal that we are not able to do things equally and we have to accept that. This is not what you can change.",Kobo Shoki,1,2023-04-04T11:11:12Z

He didn’t need to disrespect female service members of the Ukrainian military there at the end. Yes I understand his point that statistically men made the world; but it’s like he was suggesting a demographic of people don’t exist. Almost every military in the world has women that work incredibly hard to serve. He kinda called out women serving in the Ukrainian military.,lukas jay,0,2023-03-31T03:14:01Z

"Andrew Tate is wrong on this issue...historically males of the species were just sperm donors who left after the sex was over they were gone, andcthe females raised the young on their own. Yes, in some species where the males remained it improved survival, but they were still optional. For humans and most of human history, this same pattern existed, matriarchy was the dominant form of society until recent history. Women had multiple mated, and there were only ""uncles"", not ""fathers""...this had advantages, it was functional. It's only in recent history where men had wealth and power equal to or better than women, where they needed to know who their offspring were to inherent the wealth and power that this dynamic change, and it was then that men started to change women's roles...thesexare undeniable facts. Andrew's version applies only to a short recent time period, and is conditional...if women aßerted themselves, as they did in WWI and II, they most certainly could return to matriarch...",Randall Chase,0,2023-03-04T04:49:56Z

We are equal in opportunities and rights to a degree (because laws usually favour women in custody and divorce settlements). But we're not truly equal. Men can't bare children and lack emotional bonding with children like women can, women's brains can multitask much efficiently than men, men have more innovative inventive problem solving brains, women have higher patience and resistance to emotional damage and live longer...etc

I also got to wonder what he considers a game as well.  Does he consider an advanced flight simulator a ""video game"" as well?  What does he think about men who are into the flying RC hobby/Drones/Paramotoring etc?  Are those guys ""losers"" as well because they don't constantly revolve their life around getting the nookie?

"Difference between men and women. The clothes dryer stopped working. A man, with zero familiarity of how a clothes dryer works, will spend time on YT, take apart the dryer, learn a bit about the machine's insides, diagnose the problem (maybe wrongly but still try to diagnose), attempt to fix, put the dryer back together and hopefully fix it. A woman will just tell her man to spend money to hire another man (technician) to fix it and prevent the man from being a man and fixing something. Or, if she's alone and miserable, she'll ask for help from a friend who's a man, or pay a technician with her own money to fix it.   Very few women are truly self-sufficient.

Andrew is disgusting because he is basically saying only virgins have high value BUT he has said he will not be friends with a man unless the man is actively picking up girls.  And when he says picking up girls he means sleeping with them. He looks down on virgin men and men with low body counts.  Tristan and him make it their business to go online every day looking for women ( married or single they don’t care) to have sx with and then recruit into their sx business.  They treat women like disposable garbage and even worse teach other males from young kids to successful adult men to do the same thing.    A true man will fight to preserve a woman’s honor. But the Tate’s ruthlessly take away a girl’s honor and then degrades her for it.  He us disgusting.,ST ST,0,2023-02-14T13:17:40Z

"This man does not even know what feminism is. Feminism is not woman being the same as man or having the same attributes, it's about woman having equal rights as men like education or voting or the right to drive a car or wear jeans or walk in the street without her hair cover or walk alone on the street not requiring someone to assist them at all times or buying property and managing money and having business, that is real feminism, not the bullshit he is talking about, those are middle ages problems, not modern day problems. That girl asked the other what would she do if one of the security guards would attacked her, the answer is simple, she could shoot the attacker. With a gun even a child can kill the most badass warrior. Andrew Tate is looking through problems from a medieval age point of view, the world is different and has change since. What i'm saying this guy is not super intelligent or a philosopher or something special, the problem is with you because you are inundated with low quality info and low quality examples in your life, the quality of content you watch and consume is the lowest of the lowest if you listen to Andrew Tate and think he is the most epic guy.

"All promiscuous men are written in history as mental, and kings and queens who acted like that never were regarded as something special. People just put up with them. Alexander the Great didn't had 100 wives, his father had like 2-3 wives but back then in Macedonia this was practiced because they needed more offsprings. After his death only his official queen and mother of Alexander the Great ruled Macedonia while Alexander was at war conquering till she died. She reach very high status and she was like a high Priestess of Bacche and some other honors.  This is from the official writing we have about Alexander: Curtius reports, ""He scorned sensual pleasures to such an extent that his mother was anxious lest he be unable to beget offspring."" To encourage a relationship with a woman, King Philip and Olympias were said to have brought in a high-priced Thessalian courtesan named Callixena. "" Julius Cesear the one and only, wasn't promiscuous, he was seduced by Cleopatra, read the book ""Art of Seduction"", he left her only after intense pressure from Rome to get married a roman lady from higher class. But after 2 years he couldn't anymore stay away and return to Egypt and lived with Cleopatra. This is not a promiscuous man.  Do you people know what promiscuous means? do you know that the people who behave like this is an actual mental illness? Those people cannot be seduced, or be in love.  Nymphomania, the situation of a woman characterized by morbid or uncontrolled sexual desire, and satyriasis, the male equivalent of excessive sexual activity.  All those people who had many lovers are simply mental, ""Disorders of exaggerated sexuality, nymphomania in the female and satyriasis in the male, believed to be caused by pituitary gland dysfunction or irritation"".  This is what you think as masculinity? a mental disease? hahahaha and he dares to say he DESTOYS feminism???? really???? He is shitting all over history!

So somewhere along 500000 pounds in her lifetime. My dear all women around the world would act ultra feminine for that passport. So come back to reality.,subra subra,0,2023-01-22T10:20:27Z

However, I comment my opinions or feelings a lot because I try to be open minded about the GenZ community and us older folks.

I wasn’t even looking this up because I didn’t even know there was a name for it as we are learning a lot of new terminology in life. They have a word in Wikipedia for your content and content like yours. I got the whole definition for you since I know your all about stats and things. 👇🏾read the definition down below from Wikipedia 👇🏾 Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW /ˈmɪɡtaʊ/) is an anti-feminist, misogynistic, mostly-online community advocating for men to separate themselves from women and from a society which they believe has been corrupted by feminism.[2] The community is a part of the manosphere, a collection of anti-feminist websites and online communities that also includes the men's rights movement, incels, and pickup artists.[3] Like other manosphere communities, MGTOW overlaps with the alt-right and white supremacist movements,[4] and it has been implicated in online harassment of women.[5] The Southern Poverty Law Center categorizes MGTOW as a part of the male supremacist ideology.[6] …I’m just saying if it looks like 💩…smells like 💩and giving off bad energy it’s probably 💩coming out. A lot of people like Hitler thought the world should be divided…When you teach confusion and disorder among God’s people your not doing his work period.

"Good video. Thank you! Will add to the question where are the women of Ukraine. I watch lots of videos about the conflict and I have not seen a single girl in the trenches or even a drone operator. You can mostly see them as medics and support personel but even those are rare. We have Ukrainian girls working in Bulgaria in a Liebherr factory. When I ask them what would they do after the war they say that they don't even plan to return home cause it would not be the same. Their homes will be destroyed, the roads will need heavy maintenance, etc. Men will go back and rebuild the cities, not women. And that's a fact.",PillBox20,0,2023-01-18T21:51:47Z
"To elaborate on the reason that a man doesn't de-value himself socially through promiscuity is because a man's body does not have the inherent value that a woman's body has. A man's body is expendable - to be used up and consumed in a life of effort. A woman's body, generally, is what brings about the next generation of people; the fact that a woman's body is the source children makes her body immensely  valuable - a value that a man's body simply does not have. THAT is why people naturally turn a blind eye to male promiscuity and frown upon it from females.",Brian,0,2023-01-18T19:38:17Z

Relevant 300 years ago. All chauvinistic ideals aside the fact is that in the current social construct in every field there are now women employed. A woman has now got the right to build roads and infrastructure if that is what she decides. If a woman had 4 husbands and gets pregnant then there is a thing called a paternity test to identify the father. We are not living in a stone age with primitive social requirements. Women actually don’t need males anymore to survive.,1RandomMiss,1,2023-01-13T23:02:09Z

You see there was this crime that happened in my country some years back which shocked the entire nation. It happened to this woman who had gone out with her male friend for a movie. They took lift in a bus cuz it was late n these 5-6 men tried to r@pe her. And their fragile egos couldn't handle the fact that she fought back so they shoved a metal rod into her abdomen and then threw her out of the bus and run over her. Her male friend did try to fight but he couldn't save her.  She succumbed to her injuries unfortunately but my country will always remember her as the brave girl who fought for her life till her last breath.,CocoLemon,1,2023-01-11T14:13:41Z

"I am not in the ""bash Andrew Tate"" camp. Even agree with some of the stuff he says. But this whole ""men are biologically designed to have different partners and women aren't"" talk he gives is ridiculous.  The men who he mentions weren't lauded because they were promisicuous. They were famous in spite of that fact. There is a difference. Anyone who is lauded for that fact is infamous. Which is generally not a role model most people want to follow.  You could also name just as many men who were faithful to one woman who did great things as well. I do consider a man devalued if he sleeps around. But my viewpoint of life is very different from most. Also...these women are annoying.",JEMS,0,2023-01-11T04:09:40Z

"Andrew Tate's problem is that he views life from the perspective of the divine AND the animal. They cannot exist together in peace. That is the struggle that every human deals with every second of life. He wants to live life like a Lion but then justifies his desire by saying ""God says"". If we lived like Lion's then he'd be in mortal combat every week to defend his right to breed. Find me in the Bible or any religious text that says this is the way to a life of happiness, prosperity, and peace.   Andrew Tate prescribes the cure for Feminism is the misogyny of the old days. The truth is they are both equally destructive to our culture. The real goal should be in the middle. Women deserve to be valued and defended to the death for the strengths they bring to society and Men deserve the same. Men having kids with 20 different women does not show they have value and makes them look very disposable.   Women should look for a strong man that is devoted to the death to building a family with her. Men should look for the same. If you need a goal to aim for then watch Little House on the Prairie and pay close attention to how the husband and wife treat each other. Until both Men and Women stop being selfish and start making the point of their relationships to die for the survival of their children, the human race will continue it's decline.",DH40K,0,2023-01-09T17:34:11Z

"As a Muslim, and Andrew is too he’ll have to adjust to Islam. As men can’t be going cheating sleeping around with women. Only sleeping with your wife. But can have up to 4 and it’s not for pleasure, it’s because they can support widows and if their 1st wife don’t get pregnant, to provide more than financial support than a limited benefit from the government. All while treating them equally and can’t sleep with them at the same time. It’s keeps the society stronger and dignified. It evens things out because before this Godly order, number of wives isn’t limited and now modern time polygyny is practiced as “boyfriend” “girlfriend” or “one night stand” “prostitution” and more. If someone has an issue with cheating and can support a 2nd wife instead of divorce if it has less damages and it’s better than cheating. And the 1st wife can put not to marry another wife in the contract if she don’t agree with it but it’s a Godly order than men has the option for benefit.",Khalid Bin Waleed,1,2023-01-08T22:26:11Z

"Everything he says about polygamous marriage is utter bullshit (just like everything else he says). He implies it's natural for a man to marry more than one woman but it isnt natural for a woman to marry more than one man, while in fact this has nothing to do with nature - it's just he's been brainwashed by whatever Abrahamic religion he was brought up in. Polyandry was prevalent in cultures around the world and it worked fine. For example in Sri Lanka where I live it was pretty commonplace for a single woman to be married to several brothers of the same family (the kids would have more than one father and everybody was okay with it, they didnt care who the actual bilogical father was) until the Europeans came and imposed their Christian marriage laws",Kasun Withana,1,2023-01-05T06:19:03Z

"(HARDER THEY FALL, Page 6) COMMENT: There is a famine coming and it will be specifically hard for our women who would not listen to God.  The Lord will take away the majority of men so that the women will feel the pain of a world without the majority of men around them.    Isaiah 32: [9] Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech. [10] Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come. [11] Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.    COMMENT: Next, God specifically describes how the women will be troubled.   2 Esdras 16: [22] For many of them that dwell upon earth shall perish of famine; and the other, that escape the hunger, shall the sword destroy. [23] And the dead shall be cast out as dung, and there shall be no man to comfort them: for the earth shall be wasted, and the cities shall be cast down. [24] There shall be no man left to till the earth, and to sow it. [25] The trees shall give fruit, and who shall gather them? [26] The grapes shall ripen, and who shall tread them? for all places shall be desolate of men: [27] So that one man shall desire to see another, and to hear his voice. [28] For of a city there shall be ten left, and two of the field, which shall hide themselves in the thick groves, and in the clefts of the rocks. [29] As in an orchard of Olives upon every tree there are left three or four olives; [30] Or as when a vineyard is gathered, there are left some clusters of them that diligently seek through the vineyard: [31] Even so in those days there shall be three or four left by them that search their houses with the sword. [32] And the earth shall be laid waste, and the fields thereof shall wax old, and her ways and all her paths shall grow full of thorns, because no man shall travel therethrough. [33] The virgins shall mourn, having no bridegrooms; the women shall mourn, having no husbands; their daughters shall mourn, having no helpers. [34] In the wars shall their bridegrooms be destroyed, and their husbands shall perish of famine.   (HARDER THEY FALL, Page 7) COMMENT: Today’s modern black(Israelite) women are not even listening to sound doctrine/advice from our ancestors as commanded in the book of Job.    Job 8: [8] For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: [9]  (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) [10] Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?    COMMENT: No, our sisters listening to any teacher who will tell them the lie that sounds good to them and not the truth.    2 Timothy 4:[3] For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;   COMMENT: These wicked black women will listen to any teacher who will satisfy their lust for money.  These relationship teachers will use covetousness to lure wicked black women.    2 Peter 2:[3] And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ COMMENT: The SOLUTION is for our Israelite women to repent and keep the laws, statutes, commandments, and ordinances of the Lord.  This is what will give our sisters contentment.  For our God only wants to bless his people Israel THAT REPENT and keep his commandments.    3 John 1: [2] Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.  [3] For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. [4] I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. (HARDER THEY FALL, Page 8) 2 Esdras 16: [35] Hear now these things and understand them, ye servants of the Lord. [36] Behold, the word of the Lord, receive it: believe not the gods of whom the Lord spake. [37] Behold, the plagues draw nigh, and are not slack. [38] As when a woman with child in the ninth month bringeth forth her son, with two or three hours of her birth great pains compass her womb, which pains, when the child cometh forth, they slack not a moment: [39] Even so shall not the plagues be slack to come upon the earth, and the world shall mourn, and sorrows shall come upon it on every side. [40] O my people, hear my word: make you ready to thy battle, and in those evils be even as pilgrims upon the earth.    COMMENT: “Be even as pilgrims upon the earth” means be ready to move/mobile, with just bare necessities, at a moments notice.  Also, look after others that keep his commandments(Israelites repented).    Isaiah 58: [10] And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday: [11] And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.    COMMENT: Helping the “hungry” and the “afflicted soul” of the repented Israelites, not those that do not keep any commandments.    Ecclesiasticus(Sirach) 12: [6] For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance unto the ungodly, and keepeth them against the mighty day of their punishment. [7] Give unto the good, and help not the sinner. [8] A friend cannot be known in prosperity: and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity.",Jeshurun Ben-Israel,0,2023-01-04T22:55:01Z

I'm a Muslim woman and I slightly disagree with the first point I think if a man has multiple partners outside of marriage it is disgusting and it definitely devalues him. But if he marries multiple women and cares for them treats them well and is just between them then that is a high value man. A woman having multiple partners goes against biology and devalues her. Promiscuity is harmful to society whether it's done by a man or a woman.,Sara L,0,2023-01-03T18:33:34Z

MEN that are Supporting women who are Feminists want to have sexual intercourse and relationships because no real decent woman will have that type of marriage to a Feminist believing man..NOTE, the bullshirt idea that a woman can do everything a man can do is an absolute lie..

"Ok...this one time I was moving cross country and stopped at a hotel and there was this large man dragging this woman who was fighting him through the parking lot to his car; a man saw and went to get management but no one wanted to get involved personally; me a 5'3"" 100lb woman approached the man and questioned what he was up to, and when he played dumb I threatened to get him arrested if he didn't get his paws off her. He argued at first then complied. I have social anxiety and ptsd but I am very intutive about exatly what to say to a man to get them to do the right thing as result of trauma by men. Some situations I take a different approach. By the time the man (who went to get management) arrived back the man who was dragging the woman drove away and would have taken her with him she should id have left it up to him. This wasnt a one off thing; as a woman i've protected others while males stand idly by. You are as strong to how you influence the world as you feel you are. To all the women out there who label themselves victims and men either heroes or villians; grow a spine, realize you are actively manifesting victimhood, and know that men are actually more likely to be hurt or killed by strangers than women even if mysoginists convince you to lock yourself up at home unless you have a man to protect. We're more likely to be hurt/killed/raped by a man we know rather than a stranger anyway.

"there was no feminist being destroyed😂 also the fact that tate has to refer to 300 years ago probably means his view are wrong because this is not 300 years ago. the world has evolved and changed. and tate sees womens value based on how many men she's slept with but for a man it's ok😂 does he really think  a high value woman wants a man who has slept with 50 women? definately not, he says all women are supposed to be virgins and have one sex partner, but then he says men should go fuck around with anyone they like?? make it make sense TAINT. and men also needs women😂 men and women can't survive without one another. a woman created wifi so tate could talk about his bullsh!t. and a woman and a man created HIM (wish she swallowed).  and what does he mean no women fought in ukraine? more than 10% of Ukrainian combat personnel fighting in Donbas were female, and 'more than 13,000 women received the status of combatant. facts over feeling andrew taint. and taint said that women are supposed to be with their children, but a lot of women were forced to flee with their children and andrew taint is angry because of that??😂 get fvcked, andrew taint shouldn't be allowed a fvcking platform  this is why red pill right wingers don't look at studies and statistics because they would completely obliterate the dumb shit they say",Cassu,1,2023-01-02T19:02:54Z

"1:04: Promiscuous women: ""devalue themselves because it's impossible to fuck that many high status men."" This would apply to men too. It would also be unlikely for a promiscuous man to be fucking that many high status women. But ""that's just the way it works"". Great argument there. Also, he's overthinking it. Sex can be just for the fun of it. Doesn't have to be only with ""high value"" partners, for Christ.   2:28 Difference between polygamy in the two genders: If modern science fixes the problem of not knowing who the father is then it completely negates his bloody point. And wrong in the eyes of God? Gtfo with your imaginary being. First prove that God exists and even then why we should care what he thinks. Second, adultery, in the bible at least is not gender specific - it's a sin that goes both ways. What a twat.",David L,0,2023-01-02T17:46:56Z

"It is not sufficient for the system to assassinate him. If they simply assassinate him, he will become a hero fallen in the fight against the system and his message will go on stronger than before. That's why the system needs first to assassinate his image. They need first to tarnish his public image and destroy his credibility before assassinating him physically.That's why all the concerted attack from the mainstream media against him. And it doesn't matter whether the accusations are true or false, if repeated long enough through multiple media channels, they will manage to tarnish his image.  The mere fact that the media was present at his arrest is a big red  flag. Another red flag is the involvement of US embassy in the arrest. Moreover, the fact that the media was immediately given access to images  from the raid inside his residence is a major giveaway that his arrest  was staged. Providing the media with images from within his residence is  not only a major violation of his privacy rights but also a major  violation of the legal procedure.   So, my guess is that they framed him with whatever they had at hand to  completely destroy him. And if this won't work they will frame him with  something else until they will tear him apart like they did with Julian  Assange or John McAfee.   Considering that Romania has a fundamentally corrupt justice system  completely subordinated to CIA, and considering that these days it is  sufficient to have the declaration of one woman that says she was  coerced into something to destroy a life, I don't think he has a chance  of getting off the hook. And even if he manages to dodge these  accusations, they will get him with something else and he may end up  like Julian Assange and God forbid, like John McAfee.",Marius Mioc,0,2023-01-02T12:35:32Z

"Allah says  in quran  4:3) If you fear that you might not treat the orphans justly, then marry the women that seem good to you: two, or three, or four.4 If you fear that you will not be able to treat them justly, then marry (only) one,5 or marry from among those whom your right hands possess.6 This will make it more likely that you will avoid injustice. (surah An-Nisa  4:3).    it's necessary for a correct understanding of the Quran. Here is how they explain Q. 4:3:  (i) There is the view of 'A'ishah who says that men tended to marry orphan girls who were under their guardianship out of consideration for either their property, beauty or because they thought they would be able to treat them according to their whims, as they had no one to protect them. After marriage such men sometimes committed excesses against these girls. It is in this context that the Muslims are told that if they fear they will not be able to do justice to the orphan girls, then they should marry other girls whom they like. (This interpretation seems to be supported by (verse 127 )of this surah.)  (ii) The second view is that of Ibn 'Abbas and his disciple 'Ikrimah who expressed the opinion that in the Jahiliyah period there was no limit on the number of wives a man could take. The result was that a man sometimes married as many as ten women and, when expenses increased because of a large family, he encroached on the rights either of his orphan nephews or other relatives. It was in this context that God fixed the limit of four wives and instructed the Muslims that they may marry up to four wives providing they possessed the capacity to treat them equitably.  (iii) Sa'id b. Jubayr, Qatadah and some other commentators say that while the Arabs of the Jahiliyah period did not approve of subjecting orphans to wrong, they had no concept of justice and equity with regard to women. They married as many women as they wanted and then subjected them to injustice and oppression. It is in this context that people are told that if they fear perpetrating wrongs on orphans they ought to be equally worried about perpetrating them on women. In the first place they should never marry more than four, and of those four, they should marry only as many as they can treat fairly.  Each of the three interpretations is plausible and all three may possibly be correct. Moreover, the verse could also mean that if a person does not find himself able to treat orphans in a fair manner, then he might as well marry the women who are looking after those orphans.  5. Muslim jurists are agreed that according to this verse the maximum number Of wives has been fixed at four. This conclusion is also supported by traditions. It is reported that when Ghaylan, the chief of Ta'if, embraced Islam he had nine wives. The Prophet (peace be on him) ordered him to keep only four wives and divorce the rest. Another person, Nawfal b. Mu'awiyah, had five wives. The Prophet (peace be on him) ordered him to divorce one of them. (For the relevant traditions see the comments of Ibn Kathir and Qurtubi on this verse - Ed.)  This verse stipulates that marrying more wives than one is permissible on the condition that one treats his wives equitably. A person who avails himself of this permission granted by God to have a plurality of wives, and disregards the condition laid down by God to treat them equitably has not acted in good faith with God. In case there are complaints from wives that they are not being treated equitably, the Islamic state has the right to intervene and redress such grievances.  Some people who have been overwhelmed and overawed by the Christianized outlook of Westerners have tried to prove that the real aim of the Qur'an was to put an end to polygamy (which, in their opinion, is intrinsically evil). Since it was widely practised at that time, however, Islam confined itself to placing restrictions on it. Such arguments only show the mental slavery to which these people have succumbed. That polygamy is an evil per se is an unacceptable proposition, for under certain conditions it becomes a moral and social necessity. If polygamy is totally prohibited men who cannot remain satisfied with only one wife will look outside the bounds of matrimonial life and create sexual anarchy and corruption. This is likely to cause much greater harm than polygamy to the moral and social order. For this reason the Qur'an has allowed those who feel the need for it to resort to polygamy. Those who consider it an evil in itself may certainly denounce it in disregard of the Qur'an and may even argue for its abolition. But they have no right to attribute such a view to the Qur'an, for it has expressed its permission of polygamy in quite categorical terms. Indeed, there is not the slightest hint in the Qur'an that could justify the conclusion that it advocates abolition of polygamy. (For further elaboration see my book, Sunnat k A'iniHaythiyat, Lahore, 3rd edition, 1975, pp. 307-16.)  6. This expression denotes 'slave-girls', i.e. female captives of war who are distributed by the state among individuals. The purpose of this verse is to tell men that if their financial circumstances do not permit them to support a free woman as their wife then they may marry a slave-girl (see verse 25 below); if they consider it necessary to have more than one wife and it would be difficult for them to treat their free wives equitably they may resort to slave-girls, for here the burden of obligations is lighter by comparison. (For further injunctions regarding slave-girls seen. 44 below.)",S F,0,2023-01-01T19:45:10Z

"⭐🌙 THERE IS NO SUCH THING IN ISLAM: ''Oh let me commit adultery and then go back to my modest wife'' as Andrew portrait untill now. HIS VIEW HARMS ISLAM. I hope he changes for the better. I feel like Andrew didnt understand the most important part of Islam yet: AHLAQ. Which means modesty, integrity, justice, good manners, simply gaining and remaining all the good ethics and moral possible as a human being. Andrew should learn that QORAN says modest men should marry modest women and vica versa. Andrew should read the verse in QORAN, the great example of real manly AHLAQ, in which PROPHET YOUSSEF runs away like he runs away from death when the wife of the Pharao, his owner (he was enslaved at that point) offered him her love.

Hello is this guy being payed by the Catholic Church  to do a recruitment      campaign amongst the younger generation  or not.  The historical fact is the male dominated patriarchy has only been  in existence  since  a social surplus  product has been in existence with a then  male dominating ruling class taking ownership of that surplus  product  and setting up the patriacle nuclear family  to protect  this property ownership and the reproduction of the ruling exploiting class and ruled exploitable  class  for generations  to follow  as we know it today.  A state apparatus was also created by the ruling class to protect property  ownership  by armed  military force or police force if necessary. Prior to this it was a very primative classless communal and matriarchal  society. Children were  raised  by the  mothers  and her brothers.The father wasn't  included. It was a time  in history  of genuine equality  including  gender equality as women and their labour would have had as  much social status  and importance as men.,Rex McLeod,2,2023-01-01T07:18:52Z

@kenthankgod2619  Thanks for the feedback  bro and your right . Their are so many  single mother households  around  now. Women can even use sperm donors/ivf program to fall pregnant. They  don't  need  a male partner  anymore to conceive. Yes sometimes  l find myself  validating some of his points on how funking difficult and frustrating  the dating process is for men in attracting  and keeping  an ideal match. Rejection  hurts  right l get it but it can be just as difficult/frustrating for women  as well and rejection  is just part of life that you need  to get over quickly before it brings you  down.  Building resilience  is the key  to future  success.

"@Rex McLeod now I want back and read all you said, and I agree with you 💯 the world is evolving and women are catering for themselves nowadays, most women raise children on their own without a man, not sure how possible this was last 50 or 60 years, Tate sees it as tho women should sit and bear children while men should protect and feed her, some kind of 18 century caveman thinking, though I agree with Tate in some aspects like women purity and sexual responsibility, tho not all, all in all Tate goes overboard with most of his analogies and ways women should live their life.",ken ThankGod,0,2023-01-01T14:19:59Z
"C'mon bro give it a try. As the last 1/3 suggests back in what is commonly  referred  to as the caveman era. Men and women were on equal terms to each other. Ones labouring tasks were for sure different to each other but  just  as important to each other's survival . Also the father  was not involved  in the raising of his children, that task provided by the mother and her brothers or male relatives. 
My point being  as human history has evolved  so has the dynamics between men and women has evolved. It hasn't always  been  a male dominated  world as Andrew  Tate makes out it to be. Like  most women today  are prepared  to share the costs of dating  with the guy. Back in the 50s and 60s the man always had to pay every time because very few women were in the workforce  back then and were financially dependent on men for their  welfare. Now they  have their economic independence from men they don't have to put up with  the likes of Tate if they don't want to.

But when every man have seen u naked or have slept in bed with you very easily we don't feel a sense of accomplishment we don't feel like your the one. Women need to choose there right partner and stay with them sometimes I do feel like men do stupid shit as in they wait untill they get there heart broken to start taking more pride in themselves they start working out, looking after there health and looks they need to do that at an early stage to avoid heart break. Even tho I do think women should not cheat they should break up with him or tell him he is unattractive he might start going to the gym.

Men can't carry babies and give birth if we're gonna be based on physical atributes, so they need us as much as we need them and frankly i think the whole pregnancy and giving birth thing makes US physically stronger.

"so I agreed with most of what Andrew said, especially when he said that they confuse being equal with being the same. the only thing I agree with in feminism is that women should be paid the same as a man if they are doing the same job, have the same experience, and have the same level of education, nobody should be paid more than another person only because of their, gender, race or sexual preference. I did disagree with him though when he said that women need men to make their ideas happen as in all these female ideologies could not go anywhere unless men make them happen. He was right about that, but I think he didn't really think about why. Here is an example, America ( in fact most places that had slavery issues) needed white men to change the laws and abolish slavery even though black people were the ones who were protesting and getting killed while fighting for their rights, why is that? Because the white men had been the ones who created and ran the system for all those years and therefore only they could change it, it's the same with this. Women need men to actually change the things that they want to be changed because men are the ones who created and ran things the way they have been run all this time and so only when they put the systems in place to change things, can things really actually change for women in the world.",Mani Sister,0,2022-12-31T17:22:02Z

According to the bible, being a whoremonger is just as bad as being a whore and our men need to do better, because that behaviour, from men, is what has created the amount of promiscuous women we currently have. Nobody is born to sleep around. Part of being here is to procreate and have a family.

Men love women who devalue themselves.  Open your eyes. Men do not tell the truth. Women seek men who are able to provide do not tell the partner. So promiscuity is valued and respected out of the family home. Where is wholeness?,m n,0,2022-12-31T11:29:41Z
"Women seek men who are able to provide: respect, emotional depth, equal division of household labor, actually parenting their children, and intellectual engagement. Providing once meant working and that was it. Society has changed dramatically in the last 60 years and women have their own jobs and bank accounts. 

Promiscuity is easier for women. Men hate a woman whose had more sexual partners than them. It lowers her ""value"" as a sexual object because its a turn off for a woman to succeed at male acceptable behavior.

Wholeness comes when men and women treat each other as equals in a partnership. Acknowledge each others strengths and helping where the other might experience weaknesses. Getting rid of outdated ideas that harm men like real men don't cry. Real men are able to express a full range of emotions, not just anger.

Young men today are facing a crisis of loneliness and lack of meaning or direction. It's not the fault of women.. Men need to stop perpetuating harmful myths that keep young men stuck. Men don't make deep meaningful connections with other men, let alone women. Emotions are not gendered and we've stunted men's growth by society accepting anger as the only valid emotion men can show.",Wick Jezek,0,2022-12-31T12:34:14Z

"As a young woman in America I was taught how to keep myself safe from men. 1 in 5 women will experience attempted or actual rape and 80% experience sexual assault or abuse in their lifetime. It's safer and easier to just not date men. If you knew that 80% of people who ride the bus will experience a life altering accident at some point, you'd consider alternate modes of transportation. The risks outweigh the benefits to a lot of women. Most men are lackluster in bed.They don't know anything about female genitalia or orgasms. They lack even basic maintenance skills, can barely cook for themselves or wash a load of laundry. Men expect a woman to be their mother, best friend, and sexual partner. If I need help with something I have a reliable handy man who does the job.

Men know they desire women. If men started saying they don't need women we'd believe them and that would be the end of his sex life. For most men the idea of never having sex again is unbearable.

 If 80% of women will face violence at the hands of men, how many men are committing these crimes?. 50% or so of men will commit violence towards a woman. Men have the power to stop sexual violence, but so many of them are doing it they'd be hypocrites. The decent men have a responsibility to make rape unacceptable. Warn your female friends if you hear a man talking about violating a woman. Tell him you find his behaviour disgusting and unacceptable.

If it was against another man, then the irony of the question begins. There would be no need for protection against women, as these are not to be attacked.

I've never had a need for a man to defend me from another man. I've needed their height or weight to help me complete a task but I carry a handgun and go to the range weekly. Men need to stop acting like animals and assaulting women. We shouldn't have to have an escort to go outside. The fact we need to say hey men - don't rape. Somehow every woman has a personal story or knows someone in their friend group who has been assaulted by men. Yet no man knows any man whose commited assault. Men can protect women by calling other men out on their actions. Rape is about power. It's taking the one thing women can control and the thing those men find value in. Men are complicit by not speaking up and taking other men to task.,Wick Jezek,0,2022-12-31T11:12:57Z

there's one fact about life that  I'm certain : whatever the woman became or what she has in her life. she definitely needs a man in her life because it is what it is.,RetroGamer-DZ,2,2022-12-31T09:13:52Z
"And every man is born of a woman. Society is built upon the contributions of all people. The fact you interpret ""I don't need a man."" to mean ""men aren't valuable to society"" is telling. What is meant that is ""I don't need to rely on a man to meet my own basic needs"" or simply ""a relationship with a man brings more negatives than benefits."" 

In the 1950s women didn't have choices. Housewives were addicted to uppers just to ge through the thankless, menial tasks of keeping house, and the care and feeding of children and her husband. Division of labor was skewed towards the woman doing more hours of work daily. 

It's 2022. Staying at home with the kids is a sign of wealth and not a choice most women can make even if they want to. In a two worker household tasks should be split evenly. Taking out the trash one night a week isn't enough. Cleaning and cooking are basic life skills children master.",Wick Jezek,1,2022-12-31T11:41:58Z

"Ah yes feminism, the radical notion that women are human and all humans deserve access to the same opportunities. Feminism is about inequality in the systems and correcting that. Such as acknowledging women are given preferential treatment in divorce and child custody, even when the father is an objectively better parent. There are jobs that tend toward either gender but to say someone isn't qualified or can't do something because of their gender is dumb. 

The men that follow Tate think he spits facts about women, when he's just confirming their own internalized fear and hatred of confident women. Or perhaps rejection has made them hate women. It's easier to blame society, feminism, or changing gender norms for lack of success with women than it is to self-reflect. Telling women to be less and lower their standards is easier than telling men to be more.",Wick Jezek,0,2022-12-31T12:15:29Z

"​@Bryan Enzu 
The public authority that levied charges against him has a 96% conviction rate in the past, so a near perfect record (as good as humanely possible for a prosecutorial office). Tate himself has not only made a fool of himself on the internet, but practically incriminated himself online, saying that he did the very things the prosecutors accuse him of. 

here are the facts confirmed by all sources:
- How Andrew Tate made his money is a key part of this investigation.
-Police want to know whether he lured women to Romania with promises of a serious relationship or marriage, before forcing or manipulating them into working for him as models in adult entertainment chat rooms.
- They are also looking into rape allegations made by one of the witnesses (Investigators have confirmed that six women have been identified as potential victims.)
- The women - who have tattoos reading ""Property of Tate"" and ""Tate Girl"" - worked in the compound in Bucharest, where Andrew Tate lived with his brother and the models who staffed his adult web-cam business (there is a video released by the BBC of Beatrice and Jasmin explaining how they are his victims).

"As much as we both need eachother, the suffraggettes brought up a good point against the reaches of terrorists, that being sympathy magick, treating women like poppet dolls extending the reach of abuser and victim.   Also, it might have been that the demonization of Lilith and the blaming of Eve created a pincer effect of oppression and domination. Lilith was put here to represent hypergamy that advances a man to excel, and Free Will and choice for women. Whereas Eve, although Satan did ""tempt"" her,  the temptation was his own. She was drawn to the knowledge of Good triumphing over Evil in the proper use of Knowledge and Gnosis for the Greater Course of Good.

"We have to be realistic (I will probably will receive criticism for this) woman were meant to be the rib of men and men were meant to be the protector.  I personally believe feminism is a demon destroying woman’s minds with a ton of psychological warfare against men.  The devil knows once he turns women against men, women are left vulnerable not only to physical attacks but mental ones too.  Most women are not for seeing the unbalance in there lives then they complain about why they are not in a relationship and even why there own family and children are in conflict.  The devil lays a trap that grows into so many complications.  Women need to pay attention to these things",蓝洋BLUESHIFT MINISTRIES,0,2022-12-31T00:23:44Z

"It's not about the desire to get their guns and go out on the battlefield. Women simply can't do it to the same extent as a male. A 50 kilo woman cannot drag an 80 kilo male around, cannot shoot as accurately or hold a big machine gun, drop mortars into the tube, reload artillery, work on tank tracks, lift up ammo boxes. They can't do it, they'll never be able to do it. One thing they can do is multitask - 2 seater fighter/bombers have weapons officers and the male ones can frequently be overcome with information overload, that doesn't happen to women. So yes, there is a place for women in the military, the ground is not it.",Hades05,0,2023-07-01T04:08:02Z

Man should act like a man and woman should act like a woman if she wants a good real man. Only thing I can disagree and that’s from historical point of view. When he says you can’t name no women conquerors etc  trough out the history. If you using an examples from medieval times where women had absolutely no rights, to vote to chose, get burned at stake for speaking freely than that point he made was bit of hit and miss since we do have female politicians, soldiers, fighters, mechanics, scientist etc but just cause of that you shouldn’t rubbish man cause you still need man regardless and if you demand respect from a man then respect them too and respect yourself.",Dagmara Bronikowska,0,2022-12-30T22:26:11Z

"These people are confused as to what they are arguing about and what feminism is. They need to start the conversation by agreeing on what is feminism, or at least what definition of feminism they are talking about. I hardly think the ""feminist"" woman was trying to imply ""sure, I can wrestle a guy with my bare hands"".   Stating that men and women are not equal, they are good at different things and need to work as a team, perfectly true an reasonable. Stating that, because men are phisically stronger, women need to not sleep around, that is idiotic and far from having any logic to it 😅 The only problem men have with ""feminist"" movements is that it encourages women to be more open and do whatever it is they want to do. Men who are angry at women, hate that, because they hate competition. They don't want to work to be better and ""very good at being a man"", they want to just pout and threaten the woman next to them, so hopefully she will be scared of looking left or right. Big cry babies is what they are, because it's easier for women to attract men than it is for men to attract women. Yet they think of themselves as ""top G"" 🤦‍♀️",Raluca GST,0,2022-12-30T13:14:31Z

"@Maze of Mirrors I’m sure many could cheat if they really wanted to. You only need to find one more woman. One. It might not be as easy as it is for the woman, but it’s doable. 
Cheating with a bunch of woman is a different story though. 
And that’s also not what Tate means. He means it’s okay. He uses it to justify his own promiscuous behavior. Having to work for it doesn’t make it less evil at the end of the day. It just proves you didn’t have integrity to begin with.
As far as real long term value goes, Tate has none of it for a relationship. In any meaningful sense if a real marriage, Tate is very low value. As much value as a whre with a new man every night.",La Da,0,2022-12-30T14:50:57Z
"@La Da The thing is, women have innate value. Men need to work and prove themselves in order to have options. The thing is, 90% of 'loyal' men DON'T even have the options, DON'T have access to these women. So there's nothing 'masculine' about them being loyal to their wife because even in the hypothetical sense of them not being loyal, they WOULDN'T be able to get another girl. I'm not even saying they need to act on it; the pure scenario of having options defines the man and his value, and that's what Tate means. Most men today are dull and are with women who don't respect them & even cheat on them.",Maze of Mirrors,0,2022-12-30T14:31:42Z
"@Maze of Mirrors Andrew Tate is the double standard. I believe it’s bad for woman to be whres and such like Tate, but I believe the same for men. I’m a strong believer in masculinity, but think that being a loyal husband and father is more masculine than saying a “high value man” doesn’t need to be loyal to a wife. 
I don’t think there’s any real liberty is “sexual liberty”. 
Here’s the thing, Andrew Tate and I agree enough about what’s good and bad for women that I can’t overlook his behavior. I think any loyal father/husband is much more of a man than Tate has ever been. 
I agree with him about the feminist narrative, but think he personally works to perform that damage when it begins him wealth or pleasure. Eg, the cam girls.",La Da,0,2022-12-30T14:24:33Z

But when a guy who preaches male strength manages the exact same thing it's all tears and rage. Hypocrites. And yes, Tate himself has said countless times how they're trying extremely hard to silence him it's so blatantly obvious because everything he says goes against the mainstream feminist narrative that's been pushed down our damn throats for years. He's putting and end to it that's why he's arrested.

"He is saying that men can sleep or have relationships with many women but if a women do that it is wrong. Society has this idea but if we go with history actually men who are the ones who made that ideology to normalize sleeping with many women. So now tate is using that ideology which is made by men to confirm that men can shave multiple relationships and that's okay. And if women sleep with multiple men that's not okay. But actually right thing is that men or women who being disloyal is wrong.  And another thing is he said that women can't do things without getting help from men. So he said men are the one who built roads , buildings etc. Since most of the percentage who do these things are men we cannot say that women can't do those things. As a  example in my house if my father present my mother not going to change light bulbs or do plumbing. But if he is not present she do those things by herself . So my point is women doesn't need men. The right point is men and women both support each other to work forward in this world. That means no gender is superior to other gender.",Jay,0,2022-12-30T11:26:13Z

Why is the promiscuity of women the deal breaker? For some reason people are sure caught up in the comparison of women to men when keeping the same view of a society which keeps women in a bind and below. All I'm hearing is insecure men angry that women are doing what men though only they could do.   Comparing two genders based on the same criteria when the check list is in the male view makes sooooooo much sense. Quick to say the greats in history are men that has hella wives but not mention the queens that lead their people to prosperity through war and diplomatic relations then went home to a harem of men and women.

A woman who gives freely away to many with little return, what a man values highly in her….is viewed poorly. I asked her what she values in me.

"Why Tate is wrong:  He failed numerous times to even look at the western traditional union of a marriage: one woman, one man, and lots of kids. In this paradigm you know who the mother is, you know who the father is, resources are efficiently distributed for the children and even more sanctimoniously, the quality time of the father. This has been the back bone for western prosperity and why everyone is so desperate to come to the west.   I do agree that in modern times we have poisoned the fabric of our morality in the West but that is because the deep state and secret societies (👃) have villainised Christianity; the bed rock of western civilization.   Islam excuses the depravity of the man, even to the point of attraction to little girls. It also enables the promiscuity of man (up to 4 wives and countless sex slaves).   Where Christianity has been in constant battle against idolizations and accountability (Catholicism vs Martin Luther), Islam is man centric; failing to call on the man to master his environment. That is why when you look at the contributions of the modern era, you find it is overwhelmingly by white Christian males or Japanese (another culture that is deeply rooted in accountability).      Tate fails to recognize much of his own success was even possible because he was in the west or surrounded heavily by western culture (he seems to have a SA accent). While Islam is still busy trying to discuss who has custody over a woman, the west is engineering rockets to Mars.   The separation of church and state (which is why it is so easy to make fun of Christianity) as well as the action-oriention of Christianity (i.e you must do good onto others in order to go to heaven) is why Christian men are more focused on exploring and contributing to their surrounding while Islamist demand that their surrounding cater to them with no aim for human progress.   Other than that…the examples Tate jumps to with regards to his oppositions is always in the context of modern dating in shit holes like LA. A very minor amount of women actually act like this. Most women are normal. He also fails to take into account economic corruption (taxes, immigration, corporate corruption) and the explosion of the human population, which both call on women to join the workforce and the byproducts of that.

"Eeekksss! How brain washed is he!! Perks of getting converted into Islam.😂😂 Wonder which MADARASA taught him such absurd concepts??  Going by his concepts of gender he's only gloating about supremacy of male gender while he forgets the strength of being a women. Completely ignores the sacrifices, adjustments, trauma, pain-bearing a woman goes through.  He's so twisted and derailed, gives a message that women are second class citizens and should be belittled, disrepected, disregarded and humiliated. His nonsensical theories there's no value for emotions, bonding or family. It's more surprising to see a men agreeing with him.   Because of such extremist thinking world has suffered and is still suffering. women in iran , Afghanistan, india , africa, many  muslim dominated countries are suppressed n dying.  On pretext of masculinity n being Alpha male how cleverly he's making his horrible ideas as logical. New era brainwashing.",sheetu m,0,2022-12-30T05:42:35Z

"Alternative title: a man who got ratio'd by a teenager and accidently revealed himself to the romanian government rants on for several minutes about how his ideology only makes sense of you SCREAM IT REALLY LOUDLY as fast as you can without letting someone get a word in edgewise.  So a ""conqueror"" should always be looking to acquire new mates while a woman should always be looking for a new conqueror who will support and take care of her.  These statements are incompatible, since by definition the ""conqueror"" is never a suitable mate because he will not provide the resources necessary to maintain the mate.  However if the ""Conqueror"" is a woman this is a bad thing, because by doing the same thing other men do she is somehow ""devaluing"" herself.  So in the end no one gets laid and the entire human species goes extinct because no one is going to agree to mate in such a system. At least consentually, which is most probably the entire point.

"Some of the things Tate says isn't fair and comes off misogynistic but he says a lot of truths which are discredited because of misogynistic comments. Of course if a man can be promiscuous so can a woman but there are inherent biological differences. There are somethings due to male patriarchy and there are others due to human nature. Some feminist treat everything as a power imbalance as a result women are trying to do everything a man does when there's no need. It's not easy being a man either. A lot of women want to be submissive and want their partner to be stronger, make more money and be smart enough to call the shots. If a majority of women want this there will continue to be a power imbalance between men and women. There shouldnt be any difference between a male and female doctor but there are clear differences in male and female sports. The difference in biology is the reason there'll always be less female factory workers, less female construction workers less female soldiers less female garbage collectors etc... It is what it is. Lastly even though the female body his heavily sexualized and there are some cultures that choose to cometelt over their women head to toe, the feminist movement has convinced women to act like there's guys walking out here in speedos when the fact is regardless of man or woman if you go outside a certain way people will look at you and judge you. Even though men can walk around a house in their boxers There are not many places that'll allow a shirtless man and here in America you go inside any club bar or restaurant men are typically wearing more clothes than the women. There are also a lot of benefits to being a woman that men don't get. Women typically have less consequences for breaking the law, women are not asked to work dangerous jobs, men tend to leave women and children alone meaning theft assault and murder is way more likely to be experienced by men, and since men tend to make more money women usually don't have to worry about expenses. Men also have no say in whether they have a kid or not and without a DNA test have no way of knowing if a kid is there's.",JP,0,2022-12-29T20:52:24Z

"I agree with him on men and women not being equal, but I don't agree on the devalue thing. To me, if a guy is with a lot of girls, he's a whore too. He's just as devalued. Pretty worthless to me, if he's been with too many girls, because what would I have to offer him that he hasn't had already? A guy typically doesn't want a girl who has been with 10 or more guys. You think girls want a guy who has been with as many girls? No, because they want to feel special and valued. He's just using it as an excuse to be a whore and not feel bad about it, but doesn't want his girls to do the same to him. To me, from a psychology standpoint, he knows if someone sleeps around, it makes them a hoe. It makes them less valuable. The difference for him is he wants it to be an okay excuse for him, but not for a woman. This is most likely because he got a woman above his league, and now he feels like he's not that valuable because of all the whoring around he has done, but he doesn't want his woman cheating on him, because a guilty person will suspect others of doing the same, so what does he do? He does the hypocritical thing and tells her that if she does, it's so terrible. But no, not for him, because he's done it before.",The Multi Mom,0,2022-12-29T19:38:08Z

I am happy today that I'm an old man I have succeeded not being destroyed by promiscuous women in marriage lucky thing to get out early enough but I do know when women are caught being extramarital caught obviously they get angry they rage against their own sin being caught and they destroy the family they destroy the friends they destroy the relationship the man has with his sons and daughters in an effort to destroy the man for the woman's sin my experience not my opinion,uawsux,0,2022-12-29T15:37:49Z

"There is also a classic biological imperative.    Men benefit from many partners because they get even more children.    Women have a fixed capacity to produce children and are at risk every pregnancy and if they care about being a mother need a man who will serve and protect her and get children.    A man with 30 baby mommas doesn't typically take care of anyone.   Philosophically I say it this way.   Men built civilization, and women civilized men (into husbands and fathers) .  Because men are not naturally civil.",J K,0,2022-12-29T14:33:26Z

"It's interesting how he constantly talks about how women devalue themselves and what men want from a woman, yet the very things that he points out about women are the very thing that so many self-valuing women want. I personally appreciate a man with a low body count coz that's self-respect and self-love. I personally lose respect for a whore man coz I appreciate a man with morals. I don't remember Tate encouraging that in other men. His agenda seems to be all about indignifying women as much as possible.   I don't entirely blame him though coz women are the ones that give their power away by accepting mediocre men in their lives. By condoning whore men by putting them on a pedestal. I pray for our future generation of daughters to love themselves enough to sniff out the bull shit and preserve themselves for other self-preserving men.  This bull narrative is acceptable to most just because assholes like this guy are always so loud about it and act like their word is final, yet he has whored around himself but that must be overlooked just because he pushes the narrative of men being different than women.  Men are not exempt from morals. Stop the bull shit narrative.",Nonala,0,2022-12-29T10:35:34Z

"I remember working for a construction company building the light rail system in San Jose, California. Two women were hired because the company had to respect the rules by the government that any union company had to go by. Since the company I was working for was not union, it still had to hire these women who said they were capable of working like a man. One of them would not go out on the streets like we men did to set up very heavy steel panels to hold 2 foot thick concrete beds for the rails to set on besides tying steel rebar within those steel panels on both sides before pouring the concrete. The other woman last one week. It was a very brutal job that even most men would try hard not to do so   only 2 out of 10 men that were hired, were the ones who were actually doing all the hard work while the others run around looking busy. Our of all my construction jobs after that in California, I never saw a woman on the job working like us men.",Brad Holkesvig,245,2022-12-29T09:26:55Z

"Tate lost most of my respect after he started getting religious in his arguments. I am pretty sure he doesn't believe in God or any religion. This behavior just proves that he is on the payrolls of the political side which wants their business of religion to flourish. Same goes for Peterson, however he tries his level best to not use religion or God in his arguments. Using religion is a sign of weakness in the argument itself.

He does have the sheer belligerence to speak up about what really everyone knows but won't say, though, I'll give him that.  Feminism is a rot and a cultural cancer little different from the religious darkness we've just managed to cast off of ourselves in the west. I'd argue that feminism and wokeism is more a cult than anything remotely intellectual. They seem to feed on the same religious impulse and proliferate the same belief-based ignorance.

"The biggest rebuttal to Andrew Tate's argument is that he can not factually state what CAN or CANNOT or WILL or WILL NOT happen tomorrow or in the future. Just because something was accepted for centuries and up until today does not mean that it will never change or become different. Change and Death are the only constant things in Life. Anything can happen, and anything can be changed. Slavery changed, but millions thought it never would. Homosexual marriage changed, and millions thought it never would. A woman marrying multiple men CAN change even if millions think it is a sin and/or an abomination. A woman upkeeping the same behaviors as men without her being put to shame or ridiculed CAN happen even if millions think it never will. Andrew Tate's logic is not factual nor guaranteed.

How are you going to care for 10 wives and X ammount of kids?

"Real men are responsible for their offspring and take care of their children.  Yes, in the olden day men had more than one wife. That is because women often died in childbirth or babies died young before we had good medical care.  But that said, I agree that women who sleep around absolutely do devalue themselves.  But men who sleep around without commitment carry sickness and diseases around and destroy families just as much.  That is what happened with the AIDS epidemic in Africa. Men went to work in the mines, slept with lots of women, and brought AIDS to their wives and children.  So,  real women who value themselves know that a good man will love her and take good care of her, emotionally and physically.  That means staying loyal to her and loving her as Christ loves him.

when he said women can’t defend their own ideas it made alotta sense. i remember like 15/20 years ago the alphabet community was mainly gay and lesbian and things were somewhat normal cos all you had to do was avoid them and life goes. now fast forward it’s become “global issue” - now more than ever they have activists and most of the noise is coming from t/w who are biological men at the end of the day. so regardless that idea still needed men for it to hold weight,PsyRus_10false09,0,2022-12-28T22:11:20Z
"As a non feminist woman I agree with many of Andrew Tates points BUT alot of men today are pathetic too (not all, but plenty). The same way people say women are not acting like women , ALOT of men are wusses today and not acting like men. They don't do the things men should be doing where women then have to step in and do a man's job i.e. fathers who don't show up for his kids & doesn't provide a penny & abandons his partner , he runs off and doesn't take accountability or in the context of old school Arabs or Asians where a father or brother typically don't want their daughters/sisters finding their own spouse or being in a premarital relationship to get to know a man with the intent for marriage while they themselves are doing absolutely nothing to help the daughter/sister find a spouse (I'm talking from a cultural perspective here) like bro you don't want your women to find her own man yet you're doing nothing at all to help the situation & then they try and control yet fail to do the things a man should be doing. Even something basic and small like a woman being on her period in agony barely able to move and the guy can't simply go to a chemist to pick her up meds yet when they are unwell they expect the woman to look after them and feel sorry for them and care for them. I'm not saying all men are like this but I'm seeing it far more often.  Or fathers who behave authoratively and allow their sons to go to mixed schools/mixed environments because men can apparently control themselves while the daughters are being sent to female only schools/ environments cuz women are so out of control aren't they and might get pregnant in a mixed environment ? I mean that's extremely idiotic and sexust. I STILL don't believe everyone is like that but men like that lead women to develop hate towards men, and lose hope in men and become feminists (I'm not excusing all feminists cuz plenty just jump on the bandwagon , but in that context I can understand to a degree).   I'm still slightly traditional in the sense that the man who invites a woman out should be the one who pays when they go out together as love interests and if the woman pays she is doing it out of her own choice not because they guy expects it, yet so many men today will want to go 50/50 or expect the woman to pay even though they are the one who invited her out on a date. Each to their own ofcourse but these small things says alot about where we're at as a society. And for the record, I cannot stand pro extremist feminists or women who go on like ALL men are bad. The same way I can't stand sexist men.",Amoon,1,2022-12-28T22:08:57Z

"@Anna Rani Specht I would say, SOME men who have been predominantly raised by single moms have no manners and are ""damaged""

Women/Girls tend to get away with absolutely anything when it comes to bad behaviour. Boys/Men generally get a much harder punishment, especially if they behave badly against girls. These days too many are raised in single mom households, so yes things are different now, but this was and IS the norm even to this day. Manners? Asshole behaviour, well it's objective really, depends on who you ask.

But my personal experience, living with 5 women over a timespan of 26 years. One of which was a  ""friend"", and even putting my mom and my sister in this pot. I have practically never seen either of these women say sorry for anything they've done if they've been mean/was wrong done wrong, or anything else where you are/should say sorry.

Women/girls are like this because they again, tend to not have to take responsibility for what they do while they growing up. When these women OR ""boys"" grow up in single mom households, this behaviour is passed on to them quite often, which makes asshole low self-esteem narcissistic men who are stronger then women into potentially dangerous twats.

While the girls will still be how they always been, but with the abscense of a dad in the household, maybe random dudes coming home while growing up and acts as pretend-dads every now and then. Thus making these girls not really experiencing men for how they can be and mostly are. Instead, they probably see their mom ""whoring"" around by bringing home all those random men, while at the same time talking shit about the dad that might or might not be an asshole.

I agree though, there are plenty of completely idiotic asshole ""male"" type individuals out there these days. But of all of them I see, there have always been a very insecure, semi-feminine, Single mom raised shitbag shining through the persona.

These things reflects everywhere. some 70-80% in the US (I'm not from there) but also in other countries where these statistics come from. 70-80% of all Incarcerated people have grown up in Single mom households. While the outcome generally is ""Single mom"" when couples split up, the amount of total fuckups growing up in Single-dad households are barely even noticed in any statistics.

you can look at it from almost any direction,  and situation, if you dive deep and do some investigation on specific cases. You will most likely find out that that particular Asshole you're thinking of, is growing up or have grown up in a single mom household OR, is being raised by a dad + mom where the dad was raised by a single mom.

Okay and that just shows the hypocrisy of some men - why are women only respected if they’re being feminine? Because most dudes haven’t been taught respect when brought up by their parents.

"Good point for Tate, finally a man is saying out loud that cheating is not the same for men and women.  Because all men have a drive to pass on their genes, they need at least one faithful woman - and they need to be sure as Tate said. Whereas women can absolutely ensure that their children are their own.  In the end if the opportunity to reproduce is denied to a majority of men, it may well turn very, very ugly.

"Andrew Tate argument is terrible,  dumb as dumb can be... To believe that if you're not strong enough to defend your ideas you're wrong and need to submit yourself, it is pure stupidity.  As a matter of fact, it was required white people being against slavery for it to ends in the west, so apply the same logic he is using and what would we get? Well, he would not even being able to express his ideas in the west, to begin...  As humans, we have an incredible ability to relate to others, to have piety, to know that something is cruel, wrong, and bad. Right and wrong is not a matter of who is mightier, and I lose IQ just because I need to type this obvious things... How can humanity become so stupidy to take this crap ""woman can't defend feminism so it is wrong"" JESUS how freaking dumb you are... It's just so obvious that a woman with the same job as a man should receive the same amount of money. It's obvious that women should have all the rights to go to school, to choose their partners, to do the freak they want as long as they're not harming others.  Andrew Tate ideas relate so much about how stuff was in antiquity because his way of thinking is also that old. All he is saying make sense only in an old society, but times changes, and you can't stop the wheel. What would a woman do if a man is invading his house? Well grab your freaking gun and shoot the crap of the vandal... But sure, the woman in the video is probably too much of a leftist to admit that having a gun is important to defend herself, so all this stupidity at least serves a point.  A man can be dumb as much as a woman can be dumb. Equality is to acknowledge that we're not better or worse based on gender, skin color or nationality. While obvious people in better countries probably will have better education, this is not always true, so we should judge INDIVIDUALS by their own merits, not their color, country, or gender.",TrueWarlord,0,2022-12-28T20:31:40Z

"The reason sluts are not that respected by guys is akin to the reason why simps are not respected. It's underselling your value. A simp is someone who doesn't value himself, he is cheap and throws himself at any girl in the hope to get attention. Sluts are the same. They may look good but something anyone can get easily is psychologically always seen as less valuable. Vice versa alpha-males are seen as knowing their worth, same with modest women, they don't need to show off their body, they know their worth and it automatically makes them more esteemed.",CrystalAris,2,2022-12-28T20:28:45Z
"This argument is silly. I am not against men at all, but in 2022, no woman NEEDS a consistent man ( in  relationship) to be with to have protection or to lean on in life. We can hire men for protection, to build things, etc. Also all men are not created equal physically or have the knowledge or mental capacity to do all things blue collar or physical, nor protect a woman. They are also not all making enough to be real providers. So all this yelling from the rooftop about what traits apply that prove the worth of  men, which do not all apply to many men in 2022, is off based and fantasy. It's based on historical men who are not the average man of today.",4naymsake RW,0,2022-12-28T20:27:45Z

"Men are not meant to fuk around what BS Tate is spewing out - buckle up and ill tell you why. Contraception hasn't been around that long, so when men fuck around in history they are likely to impregnate a woman... A woman carries a child and shouldn't do certain physical activities whilst pregnant... So the man has to be there to aid in this domain. Then woman has child, her breasts are bursting with food for said baby... So she is biologically the home woman... She is needed to feed and supply comfort and nurture. Talking and showing the baby - toddler the building bricks of why it exists... The dad walks in and shows food, wood for the fire and a different sort of work ethic.... The child sees this arrangement... This ying and yang.... If the man was off fuking all these birds he wouldn't be able to be there and showing the building blocks of life and show the dynamics and arrangements of our existence and how we survive. Men fuking around has come around because nobody stopping a man from beating a woman who talks smack about him.... Men were the strongeat sex... Now we have laws, now we have more equality... Of course this has swayed to far the other end now and women and men can't be fuked to raise kids properly... But point is, you should have a non sexual rship until you marry, or know you want to stay with them. Society has fuked with Y'all heads if you think otherwise. Value your worth, your families worth and any child you bring onto this earth, leading by an example that gives healthy longevity. Tate is doing the same as the feminists, trans etc he is exploiting  you... Just because his shit sounds more logical than feminists and trans... Which it does...his shit is too far the other way...

"🧠✍️Stay away from movies and music if you are a true Muslim. Because you will not understand when you come into the hands of the devilAlways keep up the good work. Treat everyone well.  Everyone will help and cooperate. Always speak the truth. Satan's followers are increasing in the world, which is not a good news. More devils work to break families. Family bonding is very important.In fact, mankind is constantly losing God's test.We have to be very careful and do good family burning.Satan will always show greed. First of all Satan's factory movies and music.  Second is the media. The third is those who promote these things. The fourth is that the big companies are imposing everything on people, the works of the devil.If you are still pretending not to see Satan. Remember the punishment after death. Satan can never tell us when we will die.The world is very difficult at this time. Allah sees all. You are constantly failing the test of Allah. If you ask Allah for forgiveness, Allah will forgive. Because Allah is Forgiving. I invite non-Muslims to Islam. Because it is my duty to invite non-Muslims to Islam. Because we don't know when we die we have to be ready all the time. If you read the Qur'an, you will know about the world and life. And it is easy to understand what is true. Allahu Akbar☝️. God is greater. 😇💯 May we all go to heaven. Inshallah.

"Men and women are conditioned and raised differently. And it doesn't make sense to raise them equally.   Men from the ground up are raised to work labor and use their minds to fix up to serious problems in society and their communities. And because men find inspiration from women, we protect, provide, and shelter them. What good is a woman's education, finances, strength, and intelligence? When they pick and mate with superior men, when superior men can replace them yesterday? We need women as wives, mother's, and home makers. And extend this out to the community.   Avg Men DONT look down on Avg women because our daily struggle is not the same, we do it because women are being championed for doing basic task any man can do. And being paraded like we are equal when in fact we are not. It's like the military, and it's graduation day and all the women are being handed their participation medals and everyone clapping like history is being made. While all the guys are sinking their teeth knowing they would be shamed for the same mediocrity 🌚 nothing but the best is required form men, but women can be less than adequate in everything.   We are not short in men, we are lacking in education and raising the next level of strong and mentally fortified men who can take on the world.

"Couldn’t agree more with Tate about hypocrisy of feminism and it’s emasculation of the West. I disagree with him about monogamy - I don’t think it’s a good thing for the individual (man or woman) or society to be promiscuous! I think like porn, casual sex for men and women can be deeply unsatisfying and bereft of intimacy/deeper meaning which is difficult to cultivate the more we expose ourselves to perversion and choice. I think GK Chesterton says it best… “Marriage is a dual to the death which no man of honor should decline”! Otherwise we delineate into tribes where a small very competent sect of men get all the women and the majority of men are left out, leading to more violence/volatile society. I suspect higher neuroticism in women too! It’s one of the greatest underpinnings of a Christian society is our own personal relationship with god and our family. Jesus being the ultimate mentor and the hierarchy within the family of service and submission. The head of family - father, mother and then children. The west’s new religion is secularism/scientism - where the human and family is no longer respected or loved but reviled for crimes against nature and the rest. No longer allowed to have pride in yourself and experience has become nothing more than chasing serotonin highs! With this in mind is it any wonder men and women are struggling to find meaning in a meaningless existence.

"If it's your body, your choice, then how can the man be to blame for ""getting pregnant"" ???  If the pregnancy wasn't your choice, does that mean you were raped?  Who is the last gate-keeper of your womb, your whole body?  We put our seatbelts on, just in case.  We abhor drinking and driving, because it's life-threatening. We make sure to drive slow on icy roads.  We exercise personal responsibility and duty all the time when it comes to getting to work on time, paying the bills, feeding and sheltering ourselves.  But pro-abortion women can't be bothered to think first, before allowing a man's seed to enter her garden.  She can't be bothered to say no, can't be held responsible for that.. unless you really were raped, but over 90% of abortions are not raped-pregnancies, they're merely ""unwanted"" which is just another way to say ""mistake.""  I get it, we all make mistakes, but when it comes to reproduction, you should be doing so decidedly, preparedly, and responsibly.  If you can't be bothered to exercise those basic adult behaviors when it comes to your fertile womb, knowing your cycle, knowing your fertility, knowing you're not on Rx birth-control, knowing you didn't mandate a condom.... that was YOUR body, YOUR choice to not protect it, and now an innocent life has to end because.... feelings?  Are you really telling me wanted/not wanted is the only pre-requisite for life?  In order to be born, the bare minimum is to be conceived in the womb of a mother who wants you?  If she doesn't, that's it?  Allowing this behavior deteriorates, erodes, and rusts the dignity of human life.  I'm not just pro-life, I'm vehemently anti-abortion.",R. Mayer,1,2022-12-28T14:08:03Z

"The Harem mentality that this idiot espouses reduced women to chattels - Churchill said it best when he described the influence of political Islam... ""A degraded sensualism deprives this life of it's grace and refinement""... ""...every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a child, a wife or a concubine - (Political Islam) must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men."" I know many good muslims, but as an organising principle it is an abject failure, hence this guys rapid conversion to it. He has conned every angry young man into believing in a macho myth with himself as the ringmaster. He is a disgrace. It's clear from the way he describes women, his language (pussy), his contempt, that he has no true respect for women. We can only pray he never has any real political power in the world... he would send us back to the middle ages, where he'd feel completely at home with the toothless tyrants that made it such a special time. He speaks of Genghis Khan as if he was admirable. Genghis killed 40 million people, 10 per cent of the worlds population at the time.

"Tate tries to prove his point through Physicality  And there is some trueth behind that, Man are physically stronger then woman.  But this day an age Physical strength is not needed as it used to. Knives, Guns, Pepperspray, Stun Guns are all technologies invented to remove the physical strength and give people an advantage over physical intruders. Now 1 man vs 1 woman without weapons the man would win. But give a weapon to the woman and she will win.  Give the same weapon to both and depending on the weapon (basicly as long as its not a knife) it is more often a 50/50.  We have the ability to stall time, call the police etc  Every nuance is based on so much narrative to make his nuances work. That its weird that so many people believe his stuff Him saying there is no woman in the army and at the front line of Ukraine is bullshit! Woman can go through army training and hold guns just as easily as man can! These days wars rarely resolves in melee combat where actual strength is required.  Imagine an army of only man vs an army where both man and woman are accepted. You just opend up an army to 50% of the population Just alone of allowing woman in the army increases your headcount considerably without a big loss of strength! Because GUNS AND TANKS EXIST  Like Tates take is true, but in this day and age his take makes no fuckin sense!  The lady agrees with Tate aswel, her take: When 2 of these Strong man come in to your house what would you do. ANY NORMAL GUY WOULD ALSO JUST DIE ASWEL!!! Genuinely 2 Trained man beat 1 Trained or untrained male... tbh 1 Trained man beats 1 normal guy Like there is no point here...  The majority of males are not trained like Tate is, or have the interest to do so. Its not in their prerogative to be. Even if you go to the gym, you probably will still lose any 2v1...   Besides the fact that those scenarios almost never happen, if you live in America you can just shoot the intruder, man or woman are on equal terms there! Even if both hold a gun its the more experienced gunholder that wins. There is once again no benefit to being man or woman its just training!  Top you have turf advantage, So even in countries where you are not allowed to shoot you can rush to the kitchen and get a big sharp cutting knive Like if they have knives/guns with them you lose eitherway men or woman... Like their points have no value when you look even remotely realistically to this scenario!",Princess Narii,0,2022-12-28T12:43:44Z

If marriage is done at early age and the media and industries promote commitment and sacrifice in relationship..the world will be a beautiful place with everyone prospering with full efficiency by complementing each other's shortcomings...   Otherwise women will be made to remain naked to relax rich and unworthy(but goodlooking) men just as a toilet is used to get relaxed.  In this age of consumerism possesing best  brand of shoes,watches etc is trying to copy those rich and those inappropriate people without purpose, also shows up on having good looking partners just to show off without purpose to others to gain a kind of validation..this has become a drug and its harmful for family system and society.",Sajid,0,2022-12-28T12:26:14Z

"Meanwhile Andrew made some good points supported by facts, I wouldn’t agree with everything. Women are able to many things men can do too, and defend their own ideals. In our past, men have acted tougher, and women usually acted softer.  This doesn’t affect a woman in any physical sense, a woman can be all strong and independent, and would deserve equal respect. Feminist women are feminist women for a reason, our society slowly built a traditional rule to all that the woman should be more like this and the man should be all like that. That stuff is BS, and it’s fine to be feminist or not feminist.  Now going on to physical states, yes, men are generally the stronger ones. None of that means women can’t fight for themselves or take care of themselves, they can also stay strong as a woman. It really depends on who decides to stand up for it. Women are just usually put down by toxic masculinity and old people with sexist ideals.   I see men and women as different but equal peoples that can be anything they want with the audacity they choose to have. Being put down as a woman is an issue, but men would have their own issues. Nothing is wrong here. Both deserve respect for whatever they choose to be.   That’s all.",jaden,0,2022-12-28T11:33:19Z

But without the spilling a drop of blood 🩸 being in the battle or being anywhere near the war itself ... They say they want EQUALITY ... However they don’t want the EQUALITY  of risk ... If our lives now were the same as in 1500 years ago .... we would not be having this conversation.... And if life was not so pampered there views on TOXIC MASCULINITY would go right out  the window ... they would try and find the most masculine ALPHA MALE they could find for there best chance of survival for protection , food , safety for her and the  children ....

Secondly i also think that they try to squeeze every penny they can from a guy even if that means giving them pussy. That is what pays the big bills is popping that pussy and shaking that ass.

"Although Tate is correct on many things he is actually forgetting his history, Catherine The Great (Russian Empress) was known to have many lovers, as well as France Queen Mary Antoinette, and Egyptian Queen Cleopatra. These are some of those ""Powerful Women"" who slept around and still conquer their worlds. So for Tate to say no slutty women ever was a big wig is purely wrong. And many women don't think much of Tate, nor do think just because he sees himself as an ""Alpha"" is above looking disgust for sleeping around. They see him just as bad or worst than a slutty woman and just reenforced the stereotype women say about men. He doesn't help the male cause but hinders it further. Tate also forgets that anyone of his ""wives"" could cheat and become pregnant or if they go to see their ob/gyn and the doctor has a grudge could secretly impregnate them. So paternity is not ALWAYS a guarantee even if your entire male help were eunuchs. I know of a story where a man intending on exacting revenge save his sperm in a cryo, turned himself into a eunuch so it would enable him to work for his enemy (being he only hired eunuchs). Once he was in a higher position of absolute trust he retrieved his sperm and had it secretly inserted into his enemy's wives and impregnated them without anyone's knowledge. He confirmed his paternity of the children secretly and waited for the right moment to reveal what he had done to his enemy employer, who had never recognized his enemy. That was a classic sit and wait tactic I had ever had heard of.",Luis Castellanos,0,2022-12-28T04:46:07Z

"He is a true machist. He cannot be more machista. And by the way, he has a lot of misconceptions about Islam. He is mixing traditions with religion with machism with retarded ideas.  When Islam came, it came to liberalize women from the hell they were living during in that era in the Arab Peninsula. Women were objectified. They were literally inherited when the man dies. They used to burry new babies if they were girls. Islam came and forbid these practices. It was revolutionary at that time, because it ordered not following the practices of the fathers and grandparents if they were mistaken. So why does this new Muslim want to go back to ancient stupid practices of being unfair with women? Even the poligamy which was the 'right to be married to four wives'. It came to put a limit to the number of women to whom  a man can get married to at the same time. As in the past, they a man used to have a hundred wives. Most of the prophets used to have many many wives. Islam came and put a limit while previous religion were silent on the subject. Also, and very important, poligamy has strict conditions, it is not just that a man wanna have four wives so he can. The conditions is doing justice on each and every level to each one of them, even on the emotional level (which is almost impossible) because if he really loves the first, why having a second (my personal argument). But according to the Coran the verse says (not literally) that it says something in the meaning ""provided that you are fair, and you will never be fair"".that is why, many religious opinions even says it is clear that it is not permissible. According to many opinions, that it was mentioned like this, because the religion should be practicle for all peoples, all lands, and all times. As such, it should take into consideration all the scenarios available, so when wars happen, and there is a 'scarcity' of men, and they are very outnumbered by women, as the family is the nucleus of the society, so it took into consideration this type of situation. Or for example, if the woman is paralysed or have some disease that hinder the normal practices between the husband and wife and she is totally financially dependent on him, so ""she would be on the street"" if she does not have this marriage, then he is allowed to have (after the first wife's permission).",M S,0,2022-12-28T02:42:32Z

The Selective Service at allows you to CHOOSE if there is a WAR, and your DRAFTED, the selective service allows you to CHOOSE which branch of the service your Drafted into. because the Actual DRAFT is not elected, your FORCED to defend the Country.  99% of the MEMES around that time were women finding some DRUNK within 1 hour of the announcement of the WAR breaking out and getting INTENTIONALLY KNOCKED UP, because the military wouldn't force a Pregnant Woman to go into the Military. Funny Fact, in response to people saying this the War Department amended the Joining of a woman to be Delayed 1 YEAR if they ""Happened to be Pregnant"", HOWEVER if you have any family that is TO OLD TO FIGHT, but they can take care of the child while YOU ARE DEPLOYED.

"People hate when I say this but... After 2 decades of American occupation in Afghanistan; once America left, how long did it take the ""Traditional""  men to remove feminism from their nation? Answer: One week.  This points out two possibly three things:  1. Feminism can only exist as long as there are men to allow/protect it. 2. Feminism can only exist in developed nations; where men build the infrastructure that allows women to ""not need men"" . 3. Feminism is fragile and at any moment men can collectively decide to end Feminism.  If any one of these three things are disrupted, feminism ends, and the amazing part is; Feminism depends on men to survive.  Don't believe me? okay, Imagine a president ends all social welfare. No food stamps, housing, allowance, ect. ... How many women would realize they need a man?

"Tate is wrong about being able to cheat as a man. You should never use anyone as a means to achieve your own pleasure. Being promiscuous is inherently wrong morally because you do not have good intentions in your interaction with the other person. Your intention is to use them and then move on to the next person to use. Thus, you are depriving them of respect and dignity. If you do this long enough, you eventually make a habit out of using people. The catch is you eventually treat yourself how you treat others without even realizing it because you make it a habit.

"Polygamy is wrong in the eyes of God. Period. Don't get it twisted, Tate. The moment you try to justify or excuse why one person, man or woman, should get special treatment over others when we were ALL given a playbook of rules to follow, when those rules become ignored, you become problem child #1.   A man will never need more than 1 good woman in his life, just like a woman will never need more than 1 good man in her life. I'm sick of the entitled attitude from both sides of the aisle, and that's coming from a regular family man.  As for most other things he said, I agree with him. Women can't protect much on their own, even under pressure. ESPECIALLY against men. Feminism would've died a long time ago without men to support the idea. I mean, that falls in line with the whole ""patriarchy"" argument feminists like to bitch about in the first place. If men have always been in charge and in control, why the fuck would they ever permit feminism movement when it goes directly against the control over women? It doesn't make sense, so clearly men love women enough to give them various ways to support or protect themselves in modern society.",SeraphimDragon,0,2022-12-27T19:02:57Z

"It always comes down, with feminists to the comment “Women don’t need men to survive/flourish”! Really? 😂, in Western culture that may be true. But that’s far from true in a lot of the other highly populated countries in the rest of the world. Question: how long is it been like that thousands of years? 😂, NO, just a few decades. And it’s only like that because men allow it to Be. “MEN” VOTED IT TO BE LIKE THAT, CHANGED LAWS SO THAT THAT COULD BE TRUE. And “MEN” can change it back in the snap of a finger. The Lion/Tiger TAMER Only exists because the Lions and the Tigers allow it. The minute either one of those animals don’t wanna play the game anymore, it’ll be over. It’s the same with a highly civilized society, It can go backwards really fast. Think about it females 🤔. Many of you are liberals, Democrats want Socialism/Communism if that happens….GAME OVER! The female leaders will be GONE, Your vote is no longer needed! right now we have a ton of female leaders (which is a lot of our problem) mayors, senators, governors, Congressmen, those will all be gone.

"The Truth is when women cry for anything equality, equity, etc those things get to take effect in a way if and only if men support that cause. For example when we cried for the rights to vote, when only men had votes, it took the men in the parliaments or wherever, it took husbands, brothers, uncles, fathers, nephews etc to make it happen. So we need men more than we realise. At the end we actually need each other, that is why we are created to become 1 someday and then multipy to continue the unity and progress. The harsh reality is that at one point in life we would realise we cannot exist alone, especially women! Just saying...",Nickki L,0,2022-12-27T17:44:51Z

Sexual relations are only right and good within the bond of marriage. Outside of marriage they are fornication and adultery, and are punished by God. Faithfulness is necessary in marriage.

Women need to remember the reason they are up rn is because men think that women deserve to be equal to us. It’s not because of your skills or whatever cause without men having respect for u then you wouldn’t of got that training remember you didn’t have a right to vote but that changed because we had respect for you. Now your turning that respect we have given you against us and if you keep pushing and pushing it might get to a point when men change their mind and you will go back to being just house wives…..

The reason for the double standard about body counts is anthropological; what a woman wants from a man is financial and physical security. What a man wants from a woman is sexual exclusivity and the knowledge the children he raises are his. A previously promiscuous man cannot 'fake' what a woman wants from him; he either delivers or he obviously fails. A previously promiscuous woman is more likely to lie about paternity and can ( and often does ) get away with doing so.,Lee Clarke,0,2022-12-27T14:54:49Z

"Feminists are too funny. They live in a society fought and built by good men and yet they never acknowledge it. These good men are the ones who provided you with security and laws that protect you in modern society. Imagine if these women were living under Roman empire, they'll be nothing but sex slaves. Even if you read any war stories, soldiers even including American, raped women wherever they invaded. It happened in both World Wars and many wars after that. These women need to wake up from that bad bitch mentality",Kill Bill,1,2022-12-27T14:42:48Z
"Andrews Tates comments has fallacies in it. Keep in mind his idealogy is now Islam!  Women are hardly valued and free in that society within that stringent idealogy e.g Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan etc.   Andrew seems to put the value of 'Loyalty' by men as though it's unimportant.  As though men are naturally Disloyal; this is untrue.  As though if a man isn't loyal it's great for his progeny or in society which most culture if not all, Do Not Agree with.  Loyalty is valued by men.   To pretend women are loyal by default is stupid and untrue.  As though women are naturally loyal.  As though they're more virtuous naturally.   That's his argument... Most part.  To him a woman should never be promiscuous as it of less value but a man can be... Especially a qoute on qoute 'high value man's.   Staying loyal isn't value for a man hence the need for multiple wife's/girlfriend/sexual partners.  This is partially reinforced by Islamic teaching by it's leader Muhammad.   Keep in mind Andrew is not an old testament patriarch who took care of all his/their WIFES.  HE has/had girlfriends and wasn't married to them..didn't dowry and took them into his home as he likes to refer to historically.   At most; Those historic men who slept with multiple women that didn't marry them still had wife or wife's!   - P.s this doesn't make them right or 'top g'.  Idiots have a wife/wife's and still have multiple other concubines..  EVEN the biblical character SOLOMON admits this; Read the end of the book of Ecclesiastes. SOLOMON was a very High Value man!..at least in Andrew Tates mind/description.   High Value;  Andrew makes men of only high value if they have materialistic things or importance in society and those who also have multiple women or access to sex.... From what he's espoused in the video and in the previous videos.   To eqaute high value with wealth would mean DIOGENES wasn't of high value.  In Andrews Tates eyes he might not be but to Alexandra The Great he was.  This CHEAPENs masculinity and the idea of manhood. He DEVALUES MEN  1. Virginity in men is also highly valued  2. Loyalty in men is also highly valued  3. High Value doesn't mean sexually immoral  - ask Andrew what he thinks if high value Romans who had sex with men and with boys or the warrior spartan who had sex with boys, reportedly.  Are they still of high value?     He obviously thinks all history agrees with him. That's idiotic & comedic within itself!   1. Alexandra The Great & Promiscuity People may respect Alexandra the Great for his conquest and military achievements and leadership but it doesn't men they all think his promiscuous lifestyle; which killed him - he died of STDs; syphillis - was of value or respect. His promiscuity isn't of value to everyone. It wasn't of value to his progeny or empire; his men or legacy.   - some call that a billy goat; a man who can't control his sexual argues & desires.   In the Islamic world it's seems they agree. In the Christian culture they don't.  In many other cultures they don't agree,  Even in many qoute on qoute 'Primitive' cultures; men had one wife.   2. Virginity doesn't only prove pertainity but also confirms covenant;  Biblically the break of virginity -(the blood that was shed on bedding that was shown to family) was to show covenant; covenant coming from the term 'to cut' - as with blood covenants to form union or agreement.  Virginity in men is near impossible to prove.  But that's doesn't make it less valued.   Cultures with Women with Multiple Men;  There are many cultures e.g South Africa where women were able to have multiple husbands.  A culture in Africa, specifically the qoute on qoute 'primitive' culture had a society where the men would have sex with the women of the tribe and when a women is pregnant and gives birth they all looked after the child. Before mordern DNA testing!   There's also a culture where the women decide who they have sex with and take care of the children in a ferternity (seemingly using the men for sex); I assume they also needed the men's help to protect them in war, and in part from for them.   These are just two examples.  They show there a variants in societal cultures across the world.   Yes Women needed men to hunt, protect etc as Andrew stated but that's based on how society was structured and men and women's capabilities within that time and environment; within shared roles/responsibilities.   That lady was going to mention Queen Nzinga who was a queen and warrior in ancient kingdom situated in mordern day Angola during the trans Atlantic slavery period; who lead her people to fight other tribes and the Portuguese.   True qoute on qoute 'Feminism' would be that men and women are able to be given opportunities to do exact same things apart from where biologically they can't. Societies change and some societies like the Benin saw the value in warrior women; Dahomey Women, as did some celts and a few examples of female warriors around the world like in Japan. Ofcourse Joan Of Arc in France.   Let's not pretend women didn't fight in wars or battles for their lands and families...although the majority was done by men in ancient times and now.   This is primarily due to the nature of men; biologically, societally - we're trained to do so e.g in how they protected women in pregnancy.   The effiminisation of men especially in the west is appalling but Wakayami Gensai was said to be soft and gentile looking. One of the greatest samurai's of Japan.  We need to get rid of the idea of masculinity being this Only and truly Cold, Hard, non emotional, stoic and women hating... It's not true at all.   What did men fight for; life, family & land, pay & glory.  They also fought in pride & foolishness and evil; e.g superiority etc   We also have to get rid of the idea that men aren't men if they're stoic or crying all the time.  Jesus was a ""high value man""; changed the world but also *wept* publically when his friend; lazarus died! He was a carpenter by trade by the way, they weren't ""soft"".  How men are raised plays a part in many cultures for many reasons throughout the centuries from; pride, control of emotions, war, unhealthy teachings of witholding emotions e.g tears to be seen as manly & survival.   That women wants respect & I assume Andrew wants respect too. YOUR RESPECT ISN'T ANOTHER'S PERSONS RESPECT! ...  Various people have various ideas of respect across many cultures  - criminals have a different 'respect'  - traditionalist have a different 'respect' with one or two wife's  - western culture has a different 'respect' - religions have a different 'respect'  - martial artists have a different 'respect'  - liberals have a different 'respect' with multiple men  From where does the meaning/value of respect come from?  The interviewer - Pearl - should have asked this and is obviously on Andrews side.   In Andrews religion there's no respect for women; 1. Men are allowed to beat their wifes. 3.A man can say 'talag' three times and thus divorce his wife, Whereas the woman cannot do the same. > https://youtu.be/enB7jrR5gkY   Lastly SHE SHOULD LEARN TO FIGHT like Queen Nzinga! Simple!  On the topic of fighting;  I think it's very simplistic to think The Afghani army left protecting the girls schools because the Taliban was coming and they didn't want to defend 'feminism' - girls going to school.   Various possible reasons;  1. They didn't really believe in the cause of girl schools but did so in the wind of change at the time.  2. They did it at the time for money and security in Afghanistan 3. They wanted to escape the terror of the Taliban as the American left as we saw with many afghanis holding on the planes.  4. They lost heart knowing their situation being they had no military support from the US against the Taliban.  5. They believed in girls going to school but weren't willing to lay their life down for it in the face of Taliban onslaught they would face.   Let's keep in mind the PKK fought ISIS and many were women.",Vessel Music,0,2022-12-27T14:40:23Z

"I’m curious at what point the suffrage and women’s movement went from wanting the legal parity with men and ability to personally manage our finances and work with out harassment to this modern day 304 bullshit. I’ll say this too, to know a man sleeps around isn’t attractive either. Regardless of gender if you sleep around, not only is it apparent you hold no value in yourself, you are open to the very real suspicion of having/had all manner of STDs. How is it reasonable to demand respect from others when you hold such little respect for yourself, your health and the health of others when you sleep around.",Reply?who?me?,0,2022-12-27T14:30:21Z

The labour women put in for childbirth is equivalent to a man wakkng up at 5 every morning and pulling 10+ hour shifts to support his woman. every arguement you’ve made at me is simply because youre ungrateful of the role men play and the things men have done for women to live this comfortable in the first world.",John Dang,0,2022-12-30T02:47:56Z

The only difference is men aren't ok sharing one woman.

"it was only older woman like the granny with the RPG 7 that actually fight back. The rest just fled, and left the men to fight back. This how it has always been. Youth is valued. Youth is seen as something that is needed to keep a society running. And so is being female. And that's exactly why young woman flee the scene, they are as scared if not more scared than everyone else, but are valued to help repopulate a society. Young men, old men and woman on the other hand stay behind in war as seen in the Afghanistan war and Iraq Insurgency war. Young men and old men and woman are not as valued, and therefore stay behind as a civilian fighting barrier to allow young woman to escape.

"If Andrew Tate is the definition of a true man...the world is going to hell. Because I could only watch a few minutes of his rhetoric before switching off, let me know if I've misunderstood the msg he's sending: if you're a 'man' with enough money then you can go around sleeping with anyone anytime whenever you want even if you're in a relationship or married etc. That's absolutely fine because ...why?? But a woman cannot do the same because she devalues or debases herself?? Doesn't the man do the same thing?? I'm a woman who values herself and I'd never consent to a relationship let along sleep with someone who holds Tate's views (as I seem to understand them) as I feel that would devalue me. This type of garbage is what gets young men thinking they can treat women like shit and get away with it. A real man has control over his baser instincts or inclinations, as does a real woman. Real men earn and have self-respect, honour, and decency. They should learn and know how to treat others with respect. This all goes for women as well. A true woman earns and has self-respect, honour, and decency. Tate's views don't encourage honourable or value-ridden behaviours for men - who can be just as irresponsible as women. Whilst women may need to change their ways, men also need to change their ways and strive for better. Tate's msg is unacceptable.",Sid A,0,2022-12-27T12:06:28Z

"Another way of viewing it is that, men are the ones who go after women, so if she picks ONLY you amongst the hundred guys who hit on her it makes what you have special. But if she sleeps with 100 out of a 100 guys who hit on her 😂then there’s absolutely nothing special about being with her coz she’ll let anyone sleep with her and she most probably doesn’t value herself. A successful woman who has everything that she desires, doesn’t dream of being on a yacht with many dudes taking turns on her, she only wants 1 alpha male, the best of the bunch who’s going to treat her like a queen coz that’s how women are naturally. Now keeping this in mind, since the finest women want to be with an alpha male, a man who ticks all the boxes, we as men will obviously get a thrill from having as many fine women as possible because it validates that you are the best of the bunch, and makes you the alpha man. Even if we can’t get the finest woman, the fact that you can still get some women will boost your confidence and make you feel good about yourself.",Richard Tsutsa,1,2022-12-27T09:33:25Z

"dude's an unapologetic Alpha male.nothing wrong with that. take it from a man who accrued over 400 bedpost notches just from 17-23. it did not harm me psychologically, however the women I knew who'd had even 40 lovers at that age were showing signs of neurosis as they tried to sort out the cognitive dissonance in their minds. they know at some primal level their promiscuity is wrong, yet they reason that if a man does it, why can't I? I think the answer lies in the way you end up feeling about yourself. once at a party, people including other girls were riding a girl named Kelly about her many lovers at such a young age. they were calling her ""RED SNAPPER""...I couldn't help but feel for her as tears streamed down her face, so I said, ""let me drive you home""...so I took the opportunity to do her in her vulnerable state. NO I DIDN'T, THAT WOULD BE VERY CRUEL. so I tried to comfort her by giving up my bodycount which far exceeded hers. "" Then why do boys make sport of me but not you?""  I had no answer and it was true that my friends would sit around me and ask, ""what do you do that you get more ass than a toilet seat?""  I had no answer for them either. I presume they thought I had some tried and true method which I did not. ""don't you guys think I would tell you if I knew?"" the best I could muster was ""I think you have to find something unique and special about ANY woman. don't go to the bar with a posse of friends in tow. not even a wing man unless it's an attractive female friend to be your wing woman"", but I rarely did that. let them see you are alone. always at some point a woman would come up and say ""hi, would you like to sit with me and my friends?""....WELL SURE!  the difference is the relative ease with which a woman can get laid. it takes no effort. but for a man it's a thousand times harder and therein lies the difference. even an average woman could get laid multiple times a day with little effort. would they all be quality? of course not. women need a bit more than satisfying their carnal desires. not getting that damages the psyche. men feel just lucky to be there. it's APPLES and ORANGES.",keith erickson,0,2022-12-27T09:23:10Z

"I think it’s absolutely criminal that women can sit there and complain about equality when they’ve never really had it that bad. Look at the quality of life of men and women over the past hundred years…. Men were working 12 hour days in the worse conditions imaginable down the mines, up chimneys an other various jobs that cost you your life or several health implications later on in life. If you some how managed that you was then conscripted into the first or second war…. And then women have the audacity to complain about equal rights and unfair treatment because they was expected to look after the children and put a warm meal on the table for a husband who’s literally a slave to his employer.

"andrew tate is wrong. completely. there is no difference between women and man. there is no science. andrew tate is explaining a reality that was created by the force of man over women. if going back to that start of history where andrew tate mentions ghengis khan then ghenghis took everything away from men and women by killing everyone who opposed the idea of society that ghenghis wanted. when this killing stopped the men still had too by force take gains by women away from them by force. for example the equality women strive for today is actually men taking by force women's achievements by taxation. Women were only allowed to work because governments needed to increase the tax base. Most governments are running deficits which means now women and men cannot generate enough taxation to pay off deficits. The british government allows illegal immigration from other countries in the hope these women will have a high birth rate like the countries they come from so their children can pay taxation quicker than a normal britton now takin up to forty years to produce a taxpaying offspring. A woman having many partners is not dirty or haram. A woman having many partners is validating those men with dignity, respect and happiness. this really the correct view to combat tates hatred of women. tates reality is imposed on women by force that is in no way a law of nature.

"at 3:00, i was agreeing with his argument and logic. but then he said ""eyes of god"".  sorry, don't use ideologies to back up your argument, especially religous ideology into this. its delusion. the reason his argument had merit before he mentions god is because innately from evolution and biological habits, you wouldnt know who the father is if a female sleeps around. and in chimps/bonobos there is so much natural contestation over the females  ""For reasons that are not yet clear, male aggression against females occurs frequently among primates with promiscuous mating systems. Here, we test the sexual coercion hypothesis that male aggression functions to constrain female mate choice."" Not requiring an explanation for why such mammal behavior occurs, but simply observing that this is the way things are: When males are more aggressive, dominant, controlling -->  we find that female promiscuity decreases.  And currently in the west, we find that males are no longer as aggressive/dominant partly due to modern feminism and other ideologies pandering toxic masculinity and female independence. This has led to a very high rise in female promiscuity.",Tom Bombadil,0,2022-12-27T08:03:21Z

In case they are guilty of open indecency, then do not share their beds and beat them lightly but if they return to obedience, do not have recourse to anything else against them. You have rights over your wives and they have their rights over you. Your right is that they shall not permit anyone you dislike to enter your home, and their right is that you should treat them well in the matter of food and clothing"". —- In another Hadith he said “ Act kindly towards women, for they were created from a rib, and the most crooked part of a rib is its uppermost. If you attempt to straighten it; you will break it, and if you leave it alone it will remain crooked; so act kindly toward women"".",احمد اللويمي,0,2022-12-27T06:06:13Z

"Women love to bring up the fact that “oh men can do it, why can’t I?!” As if it’s fundamentally the same thing. They compare the outcome when they should be looking at ease of access.  Why do women sleep around? Because they’re lonely, bored, depressed, or can’t control their urges. They can walk out the door and fuck a man in 30 seconds.   Men however, cannot do this unless they’re EXTREMELY high value. Even then they get ghosted, rejected.   The equivalency of men to women sleeping around is not sleeping around, because the ease of access is not the same.   What do men do when they’re sad, depressed, bored, or can’t control their urges? They do drugs, they commit crime. The ease of access to these things are comparable to women fucking around.

"3:37 He’s wrong and he obviously hasn’t studied history.    Pregnant women are able to do work (it depends on what kind, maybe) up until they give birth.    It was well documented that pregnant American pioneers used to work the fields up until they gave birth in the field.  Then they’d bundle the baby up and go back to work.  Movies make it seem like pregnant women have to be in bed after a couple of months.  Well, pregnant women are stronger than the way media shows it.  Only the at-risk people with conditions have to take-it-easy.  Others usually feel pretty strong.  So, he’s wrong.  Women who give birth have taken care of themselves without their spouse being there.    How about the women who are married to military men and they give birth while their man is on deployment.  No, it’s not easy, but the comment at this time stamp is his opinion, not the reality.  How many women, thousands of years ago, gave birth on their own when the village men were off for a major hunt?  It has been done, and there are women out here even now who have to go it alone.  Women aren’t weak.  We are innovative and strong.  Perhaps the women Tate speaks of are the ones he makes “submit”.    Nothing like hobbling someone and then calling them weak for something you insisted on.",BlackSeranna,0,2022-12-27T05:48:01Z

Secondly, Andrew Tate would never consider a person who works in healthcare a top G, yet if no men worked in healthcare who would change Andrews Saline bag when he is in hospital recoving from a nasty kick boxing loss?

If you want equality (not equity) with men then you need to embrace the ultra competitive world of men. We compete with each other aggressively. We don't pull punches with each other. In our world we will crush you. Why do you expect men to accommodate feminism? We don't accommodate other men! Trying to be a low fidelity xerox of a man won't stand in a legitimate male dominated world. You will get crushed. Don't ever tell a man you don't need him. Because then it is on site.  Better to ask for him to share of his bounty and blessings. Feminism needs to go back 2 to 3 waves and chart a better course.,3M7,0,2022-12-27T05:32:35Z

I agree with most of it but he is wrong when he said the Taliban kicked America out. America was there for 15+ years with the Taliban being present. They were education and funding the Afghan gov thinking there is a point to do so but obviously there wasn’t. Their culture and mentality is Islamic and very strict from Stone Age. When America decided to leave most of the government forces either went back to their Islamic way of thinking or got scared and forced to re join the taliban. Point is america left when it decided it was the time to leave. They weren’t kicked out by the taliban 😂 love you topG but stay out of politics don’t pull a Elon musk or Kanye. 🙏🏼,Topszn Tv,0,2022-12-27T05:24:46Z

Look it up there are women in all of those fields he mention electricians, plumbers, mechanics, engineer, etc. the thing is, that’s isn’t a major interest for women so they go for different careers that require less labor and are more chill. You can say women are lazier than man I suppose. Not dumb or incapable. That’s incorrect.   I will say men are in part stronger than women physically. That includes speed, strength as in lifting strength, and maybe agility too. However women have a higher paint threshold, higher immunity, and higher tolerance to heat.   Because of the strength that men have, it enables them to forcefully be able to take over in leadership and other things.   But if it were purely on knowledge alone, and women didn’t have the burden of child bearing, I doubt men would have nearly any more influence than women on this world.

"Thank you Mr. Tate, for using logic. Western women, whether feminist or not, don't realize it until someone has the guts to just say what everyone knows, and never stops long enough to think about. The simple logic of determining the father of a child left them speechless. That all societies throughout history have depended on that fact, is also irrefutable.

"@Fyrdman Women may be more likely to get jobs in some areas, but overall women are about 30 percent less likely to get jobs. The unemployment rate for women is much higher than for men, according to the source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Biologically speaking, even identical twins are not equal. Equality does not exist in nature; everyone is different. So, there is no point in bringing it up.

Again, what kind of ""handouts"" are they getting from the government? Privileges are not handouts; they don't get money for being women. (Except maternity benefits, which are needed because they can't work during specific period of time) They have to work, and if the employer is not satisfied with their work, they have the legal right to fire them.

There are no artificial wombs yet, but experiments have already been done on mice to turn female blood cells into sperm and impregnate other mice. In fact, it would be much more energy efficient to simply convert the cells than to create a whole procreative apparatus.
If there were no males and only hermaphrodites, sex-changing specimens, or asexually reproducing females, civilization would still survive as long as a key element such as intelligence remained. The XY chromosome or inseminating reproductive organs had nothing to do with it.

""The entire Human race would've been extinct if weren't for men.."" Again, one could literally argue that the entire human race would go extinct if there were no women. It works both ways.

How exactly is the West a laughingstock? Just because the U.S. lost one war? They've won several others, completely won the war in Iraq. And look at non-Western examples: the fact that Russia could not conquer the poorest country in Europe, with which it shares a ground border, is a complete abomination. If China tried to conquer Taiwan, the consequences would be utterly disastrous for China. It is Western civilization that controls the world. 
Moreover, just compare the standard of living in China and the U.S., the U.S. is much better, as are other Western countries. China is a laughingstock with an autocratic regime, blatant censorship and human rights violations; not to mention other eastern trash holes where the quality of life is much worse. Afghanistan or North Korea - that is some absolute degeneracy.

Which countries don't have corruption? Corruption has been around since human civilization began developing complex bureaucratic systems. In fact, there is much less corruption in the United States, much less in European countries, than in Russia, India, China and other Eastern countries, where everything is less transparent. In Russia, corruption has reached such a horrible level that they cannot even maintain their armed forces. By all measures of quality of life, people in Western countries live much better.",Uber,0,2022-12-30T18:14:06Z
"@Uber That's a false claim that women are less likely to be hired, especially in STEM fields, corporations are scouring the Earth to try and find more women in those fields for no other reason than muh equality, there's programs and scholarships for women to push them more towards those fields. Like I said there are Quotas and what not for women. You are deluded if you think they're not hired over a male. There's a recent study done that shows that even though a man is equally and better qualified than a women, she's more likely to be hired. Women are not only equal before the law they're more privileged than men are today. I'm saying women are biologically not equal to men.

And absolutely they're useless if they need all these handouts from the government for jobs that aren't productive at all. There's already artificial wombs now so women are the ones who increasingly becoming useless. There are species that don't require males so what? They're not Humans, they're not the species that sent a man to the moon and built great civilizations. Women are incapable of that. The entire Human race would've been extinct if weren't for men.

And yes the West IS a laughing stock, the only reason America is a superpower was due to the previous generations of men who lead the nation to be this way, now the US can't even beat goat herders in Afghanistan and China is overtaking them. It's declining considerably lmfao. Corruption and incompetence is so rampant that cities in the US are unable to even supply drinking water to its people, like in the city of Jackson. A bit of bad weather floods New York subway. Infrastructure is failing everywhere, you can't even maintain it. And yes crime overall has decreased since the 90s but violent crime especially murders have seen an increase in major cities, like I said there are areas where you can't go to in these cities.",Fyrdman,0,2022-12-30T16:12:59Z
"@Fyrdman The crime rate is absolutely going down, that's a fact, if you look at the statistics for 1990-2021.

Women are 30 percent less likely to be considered for a job than men, that's a fact. Especially if she doesn't have children, which makes employers worried, given that she can take 1-3 years off. They need the privilege to be able to raise a family, otherwise, if they don't have the privilege, they are likely to devote themselves only to their personal careers without trying to start a family.

I didn't say they were equal before the law, neither should they be.

""On their own they're totally useless."" One could literally argue the opposite, that males are useless by themselves, because without females' males cannot survive as a species. Many species on this planet can survive without males, it is the males that cannot survive without females. Males are simply an addition to females for genetic diversity.

""No wonder the West is a laughingstock now."" How is it that the West is a laughingstock? The highest standard of living actually exists mostly in European countries, and the U.S. is the most powerful nation in the world. One could literally argue to the contrary that China is a laughingstock with their totalitarian regime, egregious censorship, and human rights violations.",Uber,0,2022-12-30T15:35:03Z
"@Uber lol what a cope, yes absolutely crime ha increased, the reason there was a boost in crime rate is due to integration with the black community who tend to commit more crime, now with mass immigration from the third world we get much more crime. Some parts of LA and Chicago you could not go. And of course to you rampant degeneracy is just ""change of culture"", it might be so but it's a change for the worse. And again you've got no evidence that women are discriminated against, there's plenty of evidence for the inverse where it is legislated by law to favor women. The whole entire culture for decades now has been ant-male and just outright feminism. And you're defending women getting quotas and what not and at the same time you're telling me they're equal? Lmfao you're just proving my point that women can only be independent if men allow them to be, on their own they're totally useless. No wonder the West is a laughing stock now. There's a reason why guys like Tate are getting popular now. And no one said Currie did not work hard but much of the work credited to her was her husband's work.",Fyrdman,0,2022-12-30T12:50:51Z
"@Fyrdman The crime rate has not increased, that's not true. The overall crime rate has not changed much since the 70's, the murder rate has even dropped significantly.

The reason people could afford a lot of things in the '50s is because the war boosted the economy, but after that boost the economy just went back to a more natural course. Before the war, the economy was not so good.

Invention and innovation did not stagnate. Stagnation means no activity, no growth, or a state of stillness, and by that definition it is false - there is innovation: AI, image recognition, the self-driving cars, and the first successful fusion reactions with net energy gains. All this means that human civilization is progressing.

""Rampant degeneracy"" What do you mean by degeneracy?

Also, what you are basically describing does not amount to the destruction of civilization. It's just a change in culture, which is fine because culture is constantly changing, and if it wasn't changing, it would be stagnation.

""As for women, you can look around for all sorts of privileges"" Okay, then it's not ""handouts"" but privileges. Most privileges are needed because women are mostly discriminated against. Employers quite often won't hire a woman because they're afraid she might take a year of maternity leave, which is terrible from an employer's perspective because it takes a decent amount of time to train an employee and then have to find a replacement after that. Hiring quotas are a good thing because it allows more women to have a source of income so they can raise children. Society needs more people to sustain itself.

The lack of a draft for women is a good thing because from the government's perspective, women are much more valuable than men, given that women can have children and men can't.

""Politicians and orgs working to change laws and social mores in their favor"" And there is a good reason politicians do that, because it is good; women do need support. The easier life for women, the more incentive they have to raise children; without money, they couldn't do it.

That Curie stole her accomplishments makes no sense, since she continued to work hard after her husband's death in 1906. What exactly did she steal in 1911? Also, how could she have stolen anything at all during WWI, when she worked hard during that time and then, having gained experience during WWI, developed mobile radiography.",Uber,0,2022-12-30T12:33:00Z

"Listen, I don't hate Tate. In fact, much of what he says is correct. Not all, but most of it is correct. What I don't understand is why so many are blown away by what he says and they hoist him up on a pedestal as someone with all this knowledge or wisdom.  The truth is, most of what he says was written in God's word the Bible thousands of years ago. Yet most of those 'worshipping' Tate would in the same breath condemn the Bible.   This isn't Tate's fault; however, he needs to humble himself a bit and come to the realization that the only reason that he has been elevated to such a high opinion in many peoples eyes is because so many have been programmed/brain washed by an ideology that is a part of the current agenda against humanity. And those that have resisted that programming for the most part are fearful of those perpetuating that agenda. And Tate is someone that says something that is common sense and basic, but is grounding to what is 'normal'. And in a world that now views right as wrong and wrong as right, up as down and down as up etc, having something that grounds us to 'normal' attracts the masses like a moth to a flame.  Tate appears to have bought into all the hype regarding himself. He would be doing himself a favour if he took a step back, perhaps a deep breath, and accepted that he IS helping many by spreading these common sense thoughts; however, he really isn't saying or doing anything that special. A little humility will actually help him grow in his knowledge & wisdom as well as spiritually. If he continues along the path he is on, he will learn that 'pride comes before the fall', another bit of wisdom from...yes, the Bible.",Hugh Denault,0,2022-12-27T01:49:26Z

"Another important difference is that the female body acts as a receptacle during sex. This makes a promiscuous woman infinitely more disgusting than a promiscuous man due to the mechanics of intercourse. Not that either are ideal, however a promiscuous woman, and even women who come across that way set off the same alert detection in our brains as things like infectious disease and rotting meat.",ref romaa,1,2022-12-27T01:16:24Z

"Polygamy did not start among those who were true worshipers of Jehovah God. The first record of polygamy is with Lamech, a descendant of unfaithful Cain. (Gen. 4:19) But God’s servant Noah had only one wife, as did each of his three sons. (Gen. 7:13; 1 Pet. 3:20) God’s friend Abraham had one wife, Sarah. But Sarah, long barren, knowing that a “seed” had been promised to Abraham, induced him to have relations with her Egyptian slave girl Hagar, who thereby became a concubine to Abraham. (Gen. 16:1-4) Abraham’s son Isaac, born later to Sarah through a miracle, and who was the promised “seed,” had only one wife. (Gen. 21:2, 12; 24:67) Isaac’s son Jacob, however, had two wives, due to trickery on the part of his father-in-law Laban. Jacob also had concubines.​—Gen. 29:21-29; 30:1-13.  So when the Law came in, it did not bring in polygamy or concubinage, nor did it encourage these practices. In fact, polygamy was evidently not practiced by the majority in ancient Israel; primarily it was confined to the more prominent and wealthy, though not to these exclusively. (Judg. 8:30; 2 Chron. 11:21) For kings to have many wives was sort of a ‘status symbol’ among the nations.​—2 Sam. 16:20-22.  References in the Psalms, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes to happy marriages seem to take for granted the monogamous state. “Rejoice with the wife of your youth,” says Proverbs 5:18. And Ecclesiastes 9:9 counsels: “See life with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life that He has given you under the sun.” (Compare Psalm 128; Proverbs 18:22; 31:10-31.) Furthermore, the danger of polygamy was stressed in God’s counsel to kings: “He [the king] should also not multiply wives for himself, that his heart may not turn aside.” (Deut. 17:17) King Solomon ignored this warning, to his sorrow.​—1 Ki. 11:4-6.",Maria Navarro,0,2022-12-26T23:15:19Z

Tate was a little pure soul when he was 5 and he was broke but now he is a 35 years old multimillionaire and he is not probably that pure. Was it a change? Yes. Is he rich now? Yes. or we can assume that it is wrong for him to be rich because his family was poor, he used to be poor, so it is in his biology and he needs to stay poor. Makes no sense. Things change! It is called evolution.    2/ ""What are you gonna do if one of those bodyguards get into your house?/ Why you are not going to war?"" - Excuse me, who started the war? :) Who is been fighting for years and years? Men. Why is a man getting into my house? Why men can't stop being aggressive? If you want women to go to fight, let it be. Let only women fight then. Deal.  3/ Everything that we see was created by men, yes! That's because women were treated like property, they didn't even have the right to have an opinion about anything. How are you waiting for them to create anything? Lol. Women were treated always like sex objects and sth that men can have fun with, that's it. Women are just getting into professional life, and most of them weren't even let to go to school. Their only activity was to cook and clean and be a good sex toy, what were you waiting?  4/ Virginity goes both ways. Both partners should be virgins in any religion! The reason behind it is that having a long-term relationship, you are exploring and figuring out everything with one woman and man, so you are not getting bored after your 3rd time with the same person because you are just exploring everything. Stop using religions for your own interest, you are all disgusting!",Esrarengiz Bilgiler,0,2022-12-26T22:47:38Z

So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.” They said to him, “Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?” He said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.

"Here is all the reasons why Tate is wrong a brainwashed by Islam:  He failed numerous times to even look at the western traditional union of a marriage: one woman, one man, and lots of kids. In this paradigm you know who the mother is, you know who the father is, resources are efficiently distributed for the children and even more sanctimoniously, the quality time of the father. This has been the back bone for western prosperity and why everyone is so desperate to come to the west.   I do agree that in modern times we have poisoned the fabric of our morality in the West but that is because the deep state and secret societies (👃) have villainised Christianity; the bed rock of western civilization.   Islam excuses the depravity of the man, even to the point of attraction to little girls. The promiscuity of man (up to 4 wives and countless sex slaves).   Where Christianity has been in constant battle against idolizations and accountability (Catholicism vs Martin Luther), Islam is man centric; failing to call on the man to master his environment. That is why when you look at the contributions of the modern era, you find it is overwhelmingly by white Christian males or Japanese (another culture that is deeply rooted in accountability).      Tate fails to recognize much of his own success was even possible because he was in the west or surrounded heavily by western culture (he seems to have a SA accent). While Islam is still busy trying to discuss who has custody over a woman, the west is engineers rockets to Mars.   The separation of church and state (which is why it is so easy to make fun of Christianity) as well as the action-oriention of Christianity (i.e you must do good onto others in order to go to heaven) is why Christian men are more focused on exploring and contributing to their surrounding while Islamist demand that their surrounding cater to them with no aim for human progress.   Other than that the example Tate jumps to with regards to his oppositions is always in the context of modern dating in shit holes like LA. A very minor amount of women actually act like this. Most women are normal.   Pearl is a grifter that panders to incel and muslim men.",E,0,2022-12-26T21:33:59Z
"You’re wrong my friend; Christian figures go against god when they commit polygamy.

Also there has never been the original Quran. It has been
Presumed that several manuscripts all come from the same book despite their difference. But that is also besides the point? 

An illiterate can know the story of Jesus Christ and Mohammad and be a faithful follower of either religion. But the contrast is irreconcilable: one prophet would mold him to be a peaceful man that does good onto his surroundings while the other would lead him to become a war leader with black slaves, concubines, the new husband to mourning widows, and a pedophile. 

You can make a gander  of which is which.",E,0,2022-12-26T22:11:57Z
"Nice points but please you really need be corrected on Christianity! 

Firstly, Christian men are allowed to marry multiple women. Many previous prophet's had more than wife - e.g. Esau (Gen 26:34; 28:6-9), Jacob (Gen 29:15-28), Elkanah (1 Samuel 1:1-8), David (1 Samuel 25:39-44; 2 Samuel 3:2-5; 5:13-16), and Solomon (1 Kings 11:1-3). So please don't bash Islam when this is perfectly normal and allowed by the Creator Himself under specific circumstances.

Secondly, Christianity lacks an authentic source and cannot be traced to Jesus (peace be upon him) at all. Therefore the book you read today is not from the Creator. The teachings of Islam are preserved since the Quran and hadiths can be traced all the way back to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

"What he’s saying is true. He’s not that smart, he’s speaking to the basics of evolutionary psychology. Feminism has become unhelpful, I agree. The part where his argument crumbles is that modern men today are less attractive and manly then they use to be. That greatly contributes to less women marrying young. Is he going to blame feminism for that? Or is he going to take accountability like a man on behalf of men for the fact that testosterone levels are dropping and men just more soft.",M S,2,2022-12-26T20:44:09Z

"I don't agree with the biology. As a woman I was promiscuous in a different way. I was erotic with lots of men. We mimicked sex, but we didn't have intercourse. I would never go all the way. But you can still have fun without intercourse. Also women don't need men for survival. Women need to look after the baby and themselves as a number one priority. Lots of women who have been love bombed by men and then had to leave abusive situations due to abuse, they go off to make money and raise a child themselves. Also, I found I needed to go through men to figure out what I needed in a man so it was beneficial. Now I have the man I want and the dad for my kids",nicolii,0,2022-12-26T19:59:04Z

Another reason why women don’t want children as much anymore! Even the men proven to be fathers still fuck off and they are deemed top g. All the problems you just said were women’s problems are caused by men and actually women are very capable of fighting for themselves and providing for themselves what we want is men just to get out the way and stop trying to intervene on our lives. That is the male toxicity. Women can and will take up and fight for equality just get the fuck out of the way by continuing to putting us down or telling us we are weak. Have you seen women fight like we are not all gentle and sweet. Ninja nuns in Himalayans are mental. What most women want is to be given credit for their feminine strengths in society and men to stop deeming that as useless or unworthy,JB,0,2022-12-26T18:23:01Z

"Well this is bullshit because there are South American cultures where women are equal to men are expected to fight alongside men and are allowed to fuck whoever they want in their clan and the beautiful thing about it is the men don’t care who is their or not because they treat all children of the tribe as their children. When asked to defend it they said you choose to only love your children we choose to love all our children. The next strength in it is that their is a standard all men in that tribe is expected to then live up to yet recognising there are different qualities of a man which makes them valuable to the tribe. So no our western or even the eastern beliefs of men are not the right ones nor are they healthy. And why is that clear… because men like this get a platform who thinks he is all that yet speaks no bloody respect for anyone. You want to recognise a woman’s worth by who she is sleeping with or who she has slept with that does not make you a wise or great man in anything.  Ching Shih is the promiscuous woman to start with along with many sexually empowered women in pagan tribes have their stories. Promiscuous women are frowned upon for one reason alone and is they know the men who are shit in bed and unfortunately often enough it is men that usually talk the talk but can’t walk the walk. If fame and fortune is what we consider top G then women we need to start shutting these men down. I literally have no respect for the woman that allow themselves to be seen with men like this. That is not building a stronger evolutionary future especially not for women. Imagine having children with this man and the message that they see is this how could they ever respect any mother who chooses this kind of man. Men who are respectful and have some dignified silence only showing through their actions the kind of men they are would be a great start. Any man that chooses virginity or women who don’t know themselves do so because they simply cannot handle a woman who knows what’s good and what’s not. I know one thing for sure it’s rare to find any long term partner / husband that continues to treat his partner right and it certainly isn’t men like this. But this is how the man gets noticed how he makes money is to noticed with his hostility and that is more of a concern right now.  Ladies do what feels right to you. The right man will meet you along the way when you are true to yourself. He may not be a this type of man but seriously would you really want to put up with this boy who clearly has no respect for anyone.  The best thing women can do is focus on their strengths, learn about the world and choose your men wisely when it comes to falling in love or getting pregnant the rest is all about you, your pleasure and your joy!",JB,0,2022-12-26T18:14:45Z

"Many women these days are loud, noisy, smart alecky and aggressive. They go out to work, the married and singles, and many got entangled in troubling affairs with married men. Such women loses their feminineness, their womanliness, their softness and charm and allure and dignity as a woman. Men who wants women for sex can get it easily these days, and so prefer to remain single. Men do not want a woman permanently as a wife if he knew she had been sexed before. No way. Women who had been sexed by different men loses her natural aura of feminine attractiveness which shows on her face. Her face becomes stony and loses the shine. And promiscuous woman emits a bad odour. Are women aware that a man has the ability to sniff out a used woman. Women are created as the weaker sex and not suitable for some vocations. But at home as a decent legitimately married wife, she takes charge elevated and respected as the Queen of the household. For now the world is upside down, as more and more women are not behaving as a woman should behave. Steve Harvey hits the nail on the head when he said a woman can never be a friend with a man. Listen to his interview. The electricity flowing between opposite sexes is a natural thing. More often than not when a woman indulges in too many relationships, she ultimately and sadly loses out affecting her physical and mental state.",R.A.H.,0,2022-12-26T16:04:02Z

He also doesn't know about the high domestic abuse percentage etc. The women get beaten and abused for all sorts or reasons, justified by a false version of Islam. There are many men supporting the rights of their sisters, also protesting the Taliban. They also get beaten and killed. If he'd truly reverted, he should know that seeking knowledge is a must in Islam, women should be treated with respect and even though they are nor physically the same, they shouldn't be seen as second class citizens or slaves, like the Taliban wants. The women cannot defend themselves because they do not have the guns and still women in such countries fight and die for their rights, just like Iran.

I'm pretty sure he no longer does that. he stated before that one of the reasons he does what he does is because of what he saw in the interactions on those sites. he had to give the women suicide training because so many men would cam with them just to talk about their loneliness and suicidal thoughts 

... just think about that for a second, those site cost a lot probably like £2 or 3 dollars per minute if not more and men were so lonely that they would pay that price just to talk to a woman... regular guys with everyday jobs... and it happened so often that his cam girls had to have training in how to talk ppl down from suicide... if that doesn't make u realise the ""game"" is  mess right now nothing will

the 2nd point is the world is the way it is..  u might not agree with or like something but u still have to deal with it. u might be against nepotism in principle but if your friend lands u an amazing job paying 200k a year at a prestigious firm are u saying no? of course you're not. coz it benefits u. doesn't mean nepotism isn't wrong and companies shouldn't do it",Vk Deen,3,2022-12-26T16:14:03Z

"On the front line every army have a very small number of women. As a rear element, many women work in factories, hospitals, logistics and sometimes as field medics. Fields medic need to be able to drag and lift a full grown healthy male with gear on him. Same like fire fighters. They need to wear heavy protected gear while lifting 80-120kg people(if its the case).",Tineris Tineris,0,2022-12-26T15:35:59Z
"All women think they don’t need men because men have made it so that the women feel they don’t need men. And the women aren’t even thankful for that.   Now let’s see if a woman can make that make sense. If not, go fight a war and say you don’t need men. You drink clean and clear water and say that you don’t need men. You go to a hospital in which men built for when you get pregnant 🤰or get hurt and say you don’t need men. You have a business in which men buy from you often and yet you don’t need men. There are men that have wives and buy their wives so many things from female businesses and yet you don’t need men.   16 year old boys died at war so that you can say how much you hate them even though their deaths were not in vain so that you can talk trash about them or the male gender. The freedom of your speech and yet you use it to only degrade men and wonder why women are not in power.   Women are perhaps the weakest and the most vile, disrespectful, conniving, ungrateful thing ever to be created when they have freedom, power or anything that is given to them.   Now I truly understand why women were not able to vote, and why they didn’t have so many freedoms. It’s because of the men of the days of old knew about their treachery.",Luis R,0,2022-12-26T15:31:44Z
"Andrew is correct. Call it misogynistic all you want but he’s right. Men get respect by being masculine. Women get respect by being feminine. That’s true! Straight men don’t want a female that tries to be a man. Otherwise we would want to be gay and date other men. He also said you can be equal and different. It’s true. Women have strengths that men don’t have. A man may overpower a woman but women have an ability to hurt a man worse than any physical attack. When men open up to women and show a moment where they’re vulnerable the women can use that against them. Cheating is wrong regardless the gender but it is different. Women mostly cheat with their emotions. And emotional infidelity is worse than physical infidelity. It’s also easier for a woman to cheat than a man. An average man would have to put in a lot of effort to cheat on his gf or wife unless he pays for sex. A woman doesn’t have to pay. They don’t have to chase anyone because thirsty men will go for her when she makes herself available. That’s why it’s looked at as a bigger slap to the face with men. If you’re the bread maker in your household and you’re the one doing most of the building for your partner it hurts a lot when that person betrays you. All your efforts were in vain. You were building a place of refuge for your partner and kids, to shield them from the problems of everyday. So it hurts to see your partner tear down what you have built. It also sucks as a man because we still have to be back on our feet building. We still have to go back out there and continue to build, back to the dating game where we AGAIN have to woo a woman to procreate and build a life with. Nobody cares what happens to us. Our mental health means nothing because having emotional problems is a sign of weakness. It’s not attractive for the men to even have a smidgen of weakness. Hell we get blamed for the women that cheated. “It must have been something he deserved!” Women have shelters. Women have people that’ll come to their rescue. Women have people to talk to. Men have to suck it up. And they say men have it easier. We do not have it easier.",Fujimoose,0,2022-12-26T15:29:57Z

I know cuz I left a factory that was doing this back in Jan. Women don't fight, they barely work. At least in regards to a real job that's not behind a desk. Then they want us men to coddle their ass. Fuck that. So glad my woman has learned how to be a woman. All it took was 4 years of me being me for her to get it. And guess what she's still not wife material and I tell her that whenever she tries to pull shit and throw a woman tantrum. She wants to work 2 jobs and be a boss bitch, cool.

"Andrew tate is 200 percent right.   Women should behave in a way where man can respect her.   There is no need to show your body to everyone to seek attention than the person you are marrying to.    Most real women need men.  This is ture in most part of the world than in  north Americ .  Where is feminist in a war.   Learn to cook , clean take care of your family and self. Achieve your dream next.  Feminist are bullshiters.  In ukraine war , what happened to all feminist.   How did they let 16 year boy children to fight the war and flee the country.   Due to feminist bitches and some hoe, good women are being illtreated by some good , honest men.  Feminist should claim they are feminist in a certificate and work hard as men.  Most of the women just want a calm life where she can have a good husband who can provide and take care of her and show love and affection period.  Without a leader in the family,  it will not function well.   I am a full time working mom for a corporate company but without my husband support my family will be lost.   Even though I live in north America,  I am glad I learn to put my family first than feminist bullshit.   I make sure there is always hotmeals for my family before I got to work and that I have time for my children before I choose to work to support my family.   Happiness multiply when you have a proper functional family.  Most feminist have some mental imbalance.  Because of good men , women are protected.",Female Empowered,1,2022-12-26T13:32:28Z

All the issues and solutions discussed in the panel has been addressed 1600 years ago when the religion of Islam was introduced by Allah through the Prophet Muhammad (Saw). When humans try to experiment and alter with basic concepts of gender roles then you're bound to end up with a messed up society. Islam has provided the solution with rationale and signs and many societies are benefitting from it but western societies continue to tinker with strong forces like gender identities and roles and lead unsuspecting generations to their destruction.,Nafiz Z,0,2022-12-26T10:49:13Z

"He's being a representative for men without demeaning women.  He's saying we all have our position to play.  Any good coach says ""when you don't play your position, the team suffers"".   Women naturally choose their position, and inturn Men assume the opposite position (for balance).  We've found that Men being in charge of infrastructure, and Women controlling population works the best...it's simple. (MEN with) Tyranny , God complex,  (Women with)  over perversion of sex and victimhood, are the extremes of both sides lacking in self control. Modern Women want to Be Men, and hate that Men don't t want to be Women. Men are shamed, guilt tripped, shunned and disallowed by Women and (the spineless feminine gatekeeper Men) from being Men, or even re-evaluating what modern gender roles responsibilities are and PLAYING YOUR POSITION.

"I think women would feel more validated if they revisited the gifts and talents they have that come naturally to them rather than do a feeble rendition of masculinity. It is true that a man is expected to be the first line of defense when lives are at stake. Men are first to lose their lives when the barbarians are at the gate. The feminization of men is contributing to the lack of balance in a relationship both sides have become emotional beings and the stoic presence has been lost. Unfortunately, we cannot talk about this without being shamed. The burden that men have to shoulder is astronomical. Yet, because society has become so used to men being sacrificial lambs, we forget how essential men are to the very foundation of our culture. Learn to value each other mutually and you can get a win.",LEESTETIC CREATIVE,0,2022-12-26T05:49:41Z

"You don't put women in the frontlines because they are a liability when it comes to their physical capability compared to a man. There is also the fact that there are certain physical requirements that a company/pluton need to meet to in order to be able to trust each other unconditionally when it's a matter of life and death. You need to know that each member can handle what is asked of you. And that is much better achieved by having a uniform physical standard. What if a member of your pluton get's injured and you as a woman is then only person able to get him to safety? What if you need to get physical in hand to hand combat? Women would lose in hand to hand combat 90% of the time even if they have similar training just purely because of biology. Men have stronger bones more muscle which protects vital parts more endurance for longer periods of time we focus better for longer periods of time as well. All these things are evolutionary traits of men that has been needed for centuries.  I'm no fan of Andrew Tate and his beliefs. But some times you just gotta give him credit where credit is due, he does make a very cruical point, women on a general basis simply cannot compete in the physical domain no matter how much you want to believe it.",Keyboard Warrior,0,2022-12-26T04:26:09Z

Getting paid by hateful Incel men to put women down in performative settings like these,  to give them a temporary feeling of ""revenge for their lonely lives"".

"Nice. Allow me to add, on a physical level:

1. Eating crap: processed foods, high amounts of sugar, Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAS, corn/soya oil)
2. Not drinking enough clean, properly filtered water
3. Overdrinking alcohol
4. Smoking, more than a few cigars a week (over 20 different posions in one cigarette that mess with the body)
5. Not exercising/moving/using your body actively, daily, for just 20-30 minutes.
6. Not meditating/breathing properly to gain emotional control and rest mindset.
7. Not sleeping properly (look up sleep hygene and male testosterone)
8. Not learning _some form_ of self defense for saftey, strength, discipline confidence and self respect. 
9. Over indulging in porn. It rewies the brain, sets false expectations, and *physically weakens erections*
10. Not giving/getting healthy ,*non-sexual* physical touch, from both guys and girls.

"Male promiscuity hurts men through the fact they end up tied to crazy baby mums, with children they never wanted and a 18 Yr whole in their pocket. If its not a baby mum, it's a crazy ex they could of done without that took 4 Yrs of their happiness. Sometimes it's even lack of kids, because most women won't give a child to a man who won't commit to a degree and a lack of a family at 40 does not make men happy. Not being loved does not make men happy and women struggle to love to disloyal men, that is a fact that we tell you guys but you won't listen. The amount of uncomfortable, painful, and damaging experiences people in general can save themselves by choosing a level of sexual moderation shouldn't be over looked.",aliwk,1,2022-12-25T23:18:19Z

And why would the children of a woman with multiple lovers need the confirmation who the father is? If it’s an equal partnership amongst these people why would it matter?

He's for the most part, right about men. A man will protect what's his. Not a woman coming to him with some other mans child. There are some good women out there that are single moms who had a husband who died and are good faithful women. That's the exception. Those are the ones you look after.

"“If more men would see the world through his eyes, it would be a better place.”

I really wish you could experience what it’s like for a young girl growing up.  

Men like Tate feel entitled to sample all the girls around him.  He has sex with them, and afterward he calls them whores.  

How many virgins did he deflower, but then call them a whore afterward?  He probably even pressured these young girls into sleeping with him but then condemns them afterwards.

So let me explain to you what it is like for a young girl amongst people who say that “Girls should submit, that’s what the good book says.”

As an adult, I have had conversations with my childhood friends.  Out of my four friends, three of us were preyed upon before the age of ten years old.  

It’s not my locality, either.  Since childhood, I have made many friends.  Of the girls I knew in college, fully over half of them had been molested before twelve.  

The common thing amongst all of them were that their parents raised them in a family structure like this: men get to say what goes, and women are expected to be submissive.

I never wanted this for my daughters, not ever.  I taught them that they have power, but still yet, by the time my daughters were teenagers, the local teen boys tried to do the same thing to them.

Now, how is it these boys think it’s their right?!  Their parents must have told them the same old bs that because they are boys, they can do what they want to girls.

Is this the manly behavior you hope that Tate is selling, here?

I come from a family of strong women.  My mother was never afraid of belting someone who tried to hurt her or us.  She was a single farmer in our town, but men didn’t mess with her.  It wasn’t easy but she raised us the best she could and kept food on the table.  

She was really quite gorgeous, too.  She was like Marilyn Monroe, blond curls and all.  Still, she tried to raise us the best she could, but she couldn’t imagine who some of the predators were, and I was too afraid to speak up.  I was just a little kid.

I don’t like it when people say that women should be submissive- what, you think kids and women deserve to be molested and raped?

Why are you all so gung-ho to take a woman’s dignity away by taking away her power of sticking up for herself.

Submit.  Well, if you take away a person’s idea that they are responsible for themselves, if you take away a person’s motivation to care for themselves, what have you got left?

The feminist in the video who said she’d submit to an attacker, well, she’s only a feminist in name.  

What, even, is a Feminist?  I’d say it’s someone who wants to complain loudly, but they’re still afraid to handle things on their own.

A real feminist wouldn’t even need to say what she is.  A real feminist wouldn’t submit, not really.  

They might comply to buy some time to work out the next logical step where they could take out an assailant and make sure the assailant never gets up again.

How would it be advantageous for a woman to submit to a man or anyone else ruling over her completely?  It wouldn’t.  Just like it wouldn’t be for a man to submit completely to his wife’s orders.  No one should have to be completely mentally enslaved to another person.  That way is a weak way, because they aren’t working together.",BlackSeranna,0,2022-12-27T06:24:39Z

It's actually crazy to me that  we even entertain these conversations with females.as if WE are the ones who fantasize about that love shit.as if we are the ones who want to get proposed to.as if we are the ones who want to take THEIR last names. Etc etc. It's up to the man to decide ...the men as a collective to decide what is or what isn't acceptable .because by the time any of this shit is a factor 9/10 the guy has already gotten what he wants any way and it's the women who want more. If I care less and it takes less for me to be satisfied I have the power...period.we give these chicks too much credit😂 we are the team leader we decide what it takes to make it on the team.period,James Brandon,0,2022-12-25T21:41:19Z

The issue as I see it isn't that women aren't capable of looking after themselves and needing men very little, it's that they are competing in a male dominated world. We don't know if women would be any good at running the show because men haven't given them an opportunity to prove it. Let's face it, the world has gone to sh*t whilst largely in men's hands and how many men do I see on the streets protesting about it or trying alternative ways of living.

"A tate bragging about having4 wives while he is doing it in basically a uropeeyon 3rd world cuntry is punching down.  The popularity of these 'gurus' is an outgrowth of what happens when women are not required to be held to the same standards of responsibility as men. Women live empty pathetic toxic lives, they dont read books, they dont have educations and even those that do 'get a masters degree' they were pushed along because they are females not because they got good grades, which they didnt. Universities have been dumbed down tremendously.  Thats not to say that males havent played a key role in the decay of society and the rise of these entertainers like tate. But one can look at the comments section of the females 'life style' channels, all they do is post 'how happy they are that they see another video' by their 'favorite vlogger'. Women are incapable of forming their own opinion and are inherently obsessive and compulsive. There are few who actually are able to take control of themselves and that is largely due to upbringing. The females who run around roughshod squeeling at their 'favorite vlogger' or run around cock hopping thinking they can 'do better' is largely because they werent held to the same standards of personal responsibility like men are often held to.  Further, the grown of characters like tate also goes back to the 2007,08,09,10 financial crisis, the US middle,upper class and the US financial sector is the biggest welfare queen in the world. I'll repeat it again, the UNITED STATES FINANCIAL SECTOR IS THE BIGGEST WELFARE QUEEN IN THE WORLD AND THE HISTORY OF MAN KIND. The united states spent TRILLIONS, UPON TRILLIONS, UPON TRILLIONS, UPON TRILLIONS, of dollars to bail out the US financial sector and by extension the financial sector of every other part of the world that participated in the schemes that came out of the US. The offspring of the beneficiares of these grifters are 'huge fans of tate' because their own fathers are empty vessels who are used to grifting, tate is a grifter an opportunist and he is an outgrowth of that system.  in fact the whole social media sphere, not just tate but the opposite end of that spectrum, the trannys, the guys who 'fix cars' on social media, everyone who makes a video or has an 'extensive social media presence' is a grifter. Providing little to no value to society, and out of the emptiness that is assciated with performing a meaningless activity like social media presence stems an empty lifestyle that is so meaningless that it is toxic.  Its not 'toxic masculinity' that we should be worried about, its the toxic emptiness that comes with being a 'star', movie stars lead toxic empty lives, social media clowns like mr.heast, logan, all those social media 'mechanics', the 'software developers' anyone who has ever posted a video for nothing more than a 'reaction' these are all toxic personalities.  Jordan Peterson is treading a very thin line because so far the main saving grace peterson has going for him is that he posted all of his lectures, his other stuff is largely garbage that he does to keep himself busy.  The fact that there are so many people who need 'guidance' regardless of whether it is a male or female is indicative of a bigger problem at home or inside that person. Like I said, the females who 'cant wait for that next video' from whoever their 'favorite vlogger' is is just as toxic as the males they claim have 'toxic masculinity', in fact it has been females who have been leading the charge to the 'transgender agenda'. Blaming men for their own faults and ills. Females have some serious problems, shut them out and they suddenly remember they have to act like a normal person rather than some kind of empty vessel and the simpy man will try to mimic the female out of either desperation or a want to attract the female. The 'chest thumping' is often more about chasing away other suitors more than attracting the female, ejaculating inside a female to impregnate her does not require a lot of strength, the 'show of strength' is for the show.",ThunderAppeal,0,2022-12-25T21:00:23Z

"What's the truth? lmao, its becoming a trend to now blindly agree with everything Andrew Tate says, you can agree with some things such as both genders have their own strengths and weaknesses fine but he tends to ruin it by stating some bs like if he as a man wanted to change girlfriends every week its ok. Loyalty is the biggest form of respect and also any hgih value woman especially a virgin like myself would look at a promiscuous guy as low and pathetic so this on going joke about it being worse for women can go on but I'm just telling you I judge a man's past the same way they would judge a woman's. It's annoying when guys just want to be followers, select and choose what you agree with and where you should disagree. Andrew is not a saint, in the Pier's Morgan interview Piers pulled up a tweet of Andrew's stating he would never believe a woman could own a private jet because women are broke. Then when Piers mentioned names such as Ariana Grande ans Beyonce he had to deflect his answer and started talking nonsense about women and the average earning in places like Moldova? I hope you dont have a daughter because you worshiping a man that makes those comments is just sad. Andrew may have some good points but he is no saint so stop acting like he's some sort of hero.",Valeria 1444,1,2022-12-26T19:51:08Z

To have a normal decent life, with the love of wonderful feminine supportive, loyal woman.   Men ARE loyal to a fault. We know there are many ""bad boys"" but that’s a small % of fools. They are not real men. They are children. But a lot of woman are children too. Easily fooled & led by fantasy & dream.   We gave woman everything they have. We also protect them from other men. Men who are very bad. Afghanistan illustrates this perfectly. The religious BS I don’t subscribe to. I believe loyalty should be returned. That is all. Hard times are coming for a lot of people.

Also, the male conquerors Andrew Tate listed were cruel hostile savages.

All thanks to unmarried women who live sexually promiscuous lives; whom do have children with strange men they don't know, who eventually abandon not only them but also their offspring. Resulting to dysfunctional fatherless young males out here who are being groomed to possibly see the pure world as Caligula & Genghis Khan.

"it's also weird for a woman to have more than one man because it's just shows that she needs more than 1 man to provide for her which makes her look like she's more after the money than anything else, for a man to have more than 1 woman it shows that he has resources to give to more than 1 woman.  and even if it isn't about resources, then it's about parting with his genetics to others, women do not give out genetics, men do. men do not evolutionarily speaking take care of the child, it's in a sense not his child to take care of, he just gave her the ability to have a kid that she wanted and not the other way around.  women say they want ""his"" child, men do not say this, men do not think about ""how cute our kids would look like"" he cares about her being a good potential mother if at all and that's about it.  i think the reason for this is because the investment of having a child is greater with women when it comes to pregnancy and the feeling of responsibility to take care of the child before she even has it. why? because it's more of her choice who she gets pregnant by than the man who he gets to impregnate.  by in large men give to women and women mostly just receive.",Robin Blücher,0,2022-12-25T20:07:19Z

Islam doesnt say you can sleep with multiple woman and bang your way through the world because your a man. You can have up to 4 Wives! Wives who you are guardian for. So this arguement that men can have high body count is ****. Zina / adultery is forbidden for both men and women. Controversially 1 sex slave was allowed historically following War (not allowed now) but you are still her guardian. You cant go around getting a 100 body count just because your a man.

Who remember Queen Victoria as the young Gepetto who groomed and brainwashed an underaged Sikh royal hostage into becoming her ward, foster son-husband and ""platonic"" boyfriend??? Or the eldery woman who hid her own son, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale aka ""JACK THE RIPPER"" from getting rightly handled the justice system at that time for his crimes (because yes.

He’s right on some things but if he’s gonna argue the moral standpoint he’s missing a few big factors. Namely that in Islam a man is not allowed to just sleep with whatever woman he wants. If he’s sleeping with her he MUST be taking care of her as a wife. Otherwise it’s sinful and morally wrong,Stormb1essed,0,2022-12-25T20:03:43Z

"I disagree with both points of view polygamy should be unaccepted on all grounds, for family through polygamy only builds jealousy between the different family lines.  One of the most relevant old testament examples of this is the story of Issac and Ishmael. Genesis 21:8-10 shows Sarah (Wife of Abraham) casting out Hagar (Mother of Ishmael) in a fit of jealousy as she wanted Isaac to inherit the land and wealth of Abraham solely. This led to Hagar and Ishmael being cut off and surviving desperately in the desert, to the extent at which divine intervention was needed to protect them both sufficiently.  The same can be said for multiple dysfunctional families in today’s society. If a man were to take multiple wives, the children that are then bequeathed to the wives will not be as in touch with their father figure, compared to if their mother was only wife in the relation.   Granted some families are happy and will accept this doctrine however in terms of the upbringing of the child a father figure needs to be a constant and whole figure, not a partial father who occasionally has time for wife #3’s child.",DrMatako,0,2022-12-25T19:42:51Z

"I don't know what kind of value women add to these types of conversations? They'll never come up with a solution/system that would actually benefit society in the grand scheme, even if they wanted to. At best they're echoing concepts that men have already developed and implemented thousands of years ago, while believing they are somehow exempt to those same concepts because they're 'special'...   It's garbage. A waste of time. Just shut up and let men handle it like they always did through history... Listening to women just adds unnecessary convolution and confusion to everything, which is why after 60 years of doing that people in the West can't even tell if they have a penis or vagina anymore. That's definitely not because of men.   #1 rule: Stop listening to women. Most of your problems will be solved.",zennihilator,0,2022-12-25T19:23:51Z

Begging for support doesn’t align with ur viewpoint. If u were about ur buisness. U would think of a way around the hand feeding you. This is why u need to agree with Andrew. I see. Tate is smart. The two girl speaking were unintelligent at best. Equity is earned not given to the idiot girl whom demanded respect. Just like equity. Respect is earned. And woman 99.9% r not physically equal. I’m not trying to make it a deal. But equality is an illusion. Winners n losers. Very simple. Earn urs.,Edward Lee,0,2022-12-25T19:22:19Z
"I want help point out I saw the interview Pearl had with Brittany alone and it seems like it was made after this interview with Tate. Pearl made a point she wished she had less people so that Brittany was able to talk more. And Brittany mentioned she actively listens, she earned my respect hearing that due to that she isn’t so loud mouthed that she may claim to be on her Instagram because it’s just her and her camera. Personally would recommend watching that interview first and then (when it comes out) to watching this one afterwards.",Lilly Rosa,0,2022-12-25T19:21:27Z

"@Dynamic Solution • 17yr ago (edited I’m 27, none of this made sense until between 19-23/24. Things didn’t add up until I noticed aunts talking about, “men ain’t ish,” and I questioned that. My mother would tell me to get my own “bag,” and “not to depend on a man,” and so on and so forth. I always been curious about the world at a young age the thing is to me is if you tell a child, “no don’t do that,” the child is going to either or or do both: rebel or curious. I got curious to things I was told no to and later on I had to learn MY OWN SELF as to why people said, “no,” so at one point I was like, “feminism!!! Let’s go!!” Until I started questioning women acting like men and there so much more to it than that but I just started questioning things and would get A LOT of flack like Pearl for doing the thing that God wants his kids to do (I think it is spiritual in a way) to think for yourself. So all of this promiscuity Tate talked about. It’s not natural or for women, I agree but if that’s how a woman wants to view herself to taking off her clothes. Then she should not be crying men don’t respect her. You are choosing your route to things. Granted there’s nothing wrong that Brittany wants to change, I just wanna see if she follows through with her words without the cameras rolling on her or not being on IG and her promoting being a hoe.

Getting demonetized for having an opinion on social media is why sane people flock to these channels and all of these channels that are similar grow like weeds. Subscription numbers in the tens of millions on these type of channels. It's so wrong to demonetize these channels just so you can make it harder for these opinions to be shared is not going to work. People will donate to keep them afloat. I yearn for a popular platform where people can discuss various opinions and have a level playing field wiht the woke channels. Woke is the downfall of western society. Childbirth rates are less than 10 in a 1000 people in western society. This problem will simply fade into oblivion.

"A man doesn't devalue himself at all? BIG FAT WRONG You're called a man whore and I have NEVER seen that kind of man respected in both non religious and religious circles.  Now if the man has gone through several women in search of a relationships and it hasn't worked out it goes better for him than a women. A man can indeed have more partners TO AN EXTENT and it won't effect him like it would a woman. However, he has a limit and if he goes through women like a machine gun through ammo it tells men he simply can't keep it in his pants and lacks self control. It could also suggest he is very insecure and millions of dollars doesn't  make a man secure.  I have no respect for a man that goes through women like crazy. He's got loads of money so big deal, it's easy to get a woman for your wallet. He's insecure and needs a new pretty woman on his arm to affirm his image. He's always got a young woman all the time like Dicraprio and that is NOT a good sign in the least. The list could go on and on. Yes men will pat another man on the back and laugh when he talks of his exploits but when he walks out that door the mockery begins.  All in all if you can't keep a good woman then I assume the man is a flat bad judge of character and if he keeps mounting every woman that lets him then it means he chooses to ride women that don't value themselves or a solid relationship. That's one step short of hiring a line of hookers and boasting about it.  Tate says some accurate things about feminism but there is a load of bull and bluster in there. I used to be able to get ANY woman I wanted years ago and got sick of it. They didn't want me for me but instead what I had to offer. I walked away from it for years and eventually got that 1 in a million woman and am happy and thrilled. So what Atilla the hun and other dictators had loads of women, it didn't make them men of quality. The vast majority were horrid men who committed so many atrocities that history still remembers it.  Tate seems like a man who preys on the insecure men society has created. He blusters, talks over people, drowns them out and has ""help"" for men that ends up in lots of money pouring into his pockets. Do these men's lives change? Not that I've heard but he gets richer. He seems like a highly successful scam artist that dupes people because he mixes just enough truth in with all the bull.  Tate isn't what a real man is, he's what you want your sons to avoid being. Feminism is a blight and so are people Tate. Want to know more about being a man, at least take some tips from people Jordan Peterson and not... this, whatever he is. Find a person with a good solid relationship and listen.",WanderAbroad,0,2022-12-25T17:56:27Z

I hate to say it but the only way they gon learn is to do what the old timers used to do.  This all started when guys stopped slappingor even punching the shyt of of women with all this mouth. .  A guy with no strength and all mouth would quickly learn to shut the fuck up at around age 12 or 13.  She has never had that happen and  she feels invincible.  A lot of women do and it’s amazing how off from reality they are.  I once had a women slap me after I said something slick to her when I was drunk.  I picked her up off the ground by her neck and she was surprised at how I could just throw her around.

"Women - I don't need no man. I'm an independent strong woman. But I refuse to work any jobs that require me to sweat. So when I'm down on my luck. Do you want to see my butthole for 5 bucks?  Women are constantly talking about how they don't need men nowadays. But I have to ask... without men who's going to build your homes? Without men -who's going to install the electricity. Without men- who's going to do all the coal mining and the majority of any other jobs.  That requires you to do more than pressing a few buttons buttons? Who's going to fight the wars that are inevitable? That you refuse to show up for because that's not your roll in life.  Did you know that daycare centers. Were meant to be a temporary fix. During World War I or two I can't remember? So that the men could go fight the war and women can work to support their children. But women liked this idea so much . That after the war was over. They eventually made it norm..... surprise surprise Fact is I don't know one situation in today's society. Where women do not have the upper hand. Yet as time passes women get louder, lazier and more obnoxious in everything they say. At the same time I'm supposed to accept that me being a man automatically makes me a sexist and a bad guy. FUCK OFF. To the women always preaching equality. Yes we all want equality. It's getting to the point where I would love to knock a b**** out.  For getting in my face,pushing me, hitting me Etc....

"@Robert Darnhofer its not really his opinion, considering back in the 90s, his opinion today was partially the state of society back then. 

True, he is in a way over exaggerates things, but since our society is gradually getting worse, atleast he found a way to make it slightly better by speaking up for the truth. 

There are tons of ways to speak up and his may not be the best, but it works and what our society needs right now are brave men. Because lets be honest, a lot of men today are a bunch of losers, though in a few years, I'm sure they would grow into better & strong people, and when that happens, we can then find a better alternative method in finding a way to speak the truth to make society better without looking like a jackass",Bartholomew,0,2022-12-27T00:37:42Z

Now the women fighters were low in numbers in those conflicts, but some were brave enough to take up arms. But what kills me, is that women will use those small numbers of female fighters and think all women are capable of fighting. Let's be honest, the only reason women have the ability to be equal, is because men allow it; which is the right thing to do.

"I'm just giving one question, why is it so easy to invite women to have sex or living together after so many years but no status than instead of getting married?.often many do not know the meaning of marriage but have lived together for so many years and that is a strange thing. life after marriage is just like life as usual, only the difference is you women have respectable status by being married rather than free sex or living together without status. even though there are indeed things behind the marriage can to fail and mostly it is a matter of property or money which is actually an easy thing if you can work together in managing and searching for it and the presence of a third person(male or female same and I can't comment on this one and ask yourself)...so in my opinion, the status of a widow is still higher than free sex or living together without any marital status.",Muhammad Rizki Sandjaya,0,2022-12-25T17:30:08Z

"I co-sign a lot of what Tate says, but the whole ""be polyamorous guys, it's what great men have done since the beginning of time"" thing I will always have a point of contention with. I wouldn't cheat on my girl whether it's viable or not. it's just an internal respect thing, plus I know deep down it would be hurting her. just because someone accepts something does not equate to them being okay with it. if women were okay with men having multiple wives vs just accepting it because there's nothing they can do about it, they wouldn't be so adamantly pushing for the former. it's just common logic. F&F and the manosphere need to stop equating ""okay"" with ""acceptance"" women are certainly NOT okay with it, it's just if they're with a man they value enough, they'll begrudgingly accept it because in their eyes they have no other choice.",David Monroe,0,2022-12-25T17:18:35Z

In bonobos it is normal, and we are very close to bonobos as we are exceptionally close to chimpanzees as well.

@Bogus McBogus oh they do. I was gifted a vision when I was a kid and saw the future described in revelation and I didn’t even know about what revelation said. Biblical prophecy is proof God exists. There’s sufficient historical evidence that shows the Bible precisely predicted wars and events and we have the archaeological evidence to back it up and the evidence that shows these things were written before the events happened.

"@noiwont  So, did Jezebel have a demon, or was she herself a demon in human form who now goes around possessing other women globally, causing them to become out of control women? Weren't there any out of control women in existence before Jezebel tried to kill the prophet? The answer is yes, but how could those women be possessed by Jezebel if she didn't yet exist? Ok, let's assume your theory is correct. The only way to truly assess if a person, in this case a total stranger, has a demon is if you had an opportunity to observe them before any character or behavioral changes. The fact that BR is an internet celebrity and any of us know about her at all is BECAUSE of her current lifestyle and behavior. None of us knew anything about her prior to now. So if demons enter the host unnoticed, only close family and friends can truly determine with any level of certainty that BR is exhibiting stranger than normal behavior. Not you, me, or any other random stranger that just found out about her in her late 20s to early 30s. Secondly, a woman trying to control a man is just plain old-fashioned manipulation. There is no need for a demon. I personally know a few women who attempt to manipulate every situation that they are involved in with men, women, children, co-workers, entirely groups of mixed people, etc. One of them is the worst manipulator out of the group but remains celibate. All of them claim to be devoted Christians (filled with the Spirit, go to church regularly, read the Bible, believe in tithing and give money, talk about God, watch Christian TV) with very low body counts. Are you saying that these Christ professing women have the Jezebel demon too because they can do all that only God is supposed to cause a person to want to do all while manipulate and control situations like you couldn't believe! You seem to be taking separate and unrelated behaviors and lumping them together and diagnosing it as a Jezebel demon. Jezebel was a murderous woman. I haven't seen or heard anything about BR making any attempts on anyone's life. The last point that I would make is that BR is selective with her high body count (I don't condone having high body counts, simply making a point about demon possession). She is not sleeping with every man she finds physically attractive but rather is specifically targeting rich men only. It's a calculated money-making business practice. It's not right, but it's not a fail proof way to assess demon possession. Just because people do bad things and make horrible life choices doesn't mean that the only possible explanation is that they must be possessed by a demon.",Jon Hosey,0,2022-12-28T14:48:14Z
"@noiwont  I'm not an advocate for BR, but come on, a demon? She might have driven her life into a ditch in front of the entire internet, but she doesn’t have to have a demon. Horrible decision-making skills and a terrible attitude, yes, but not a demon. In another clip from this same episode, Brittany went out of her way to specifically ask Andrew for any advice that he would give to a woman in her situation. He gave her some solid, well thought out advice, and she sat quietly and listened to him respectfully. Jezebel seeks no advice and listens to no one. So no, not a demon. Whether she takes his advice remains to be seen, but demon possessed people usually don't ask for situational life advice.",Jon Hosey,0,2022-12-27T00:28:54Z

Tate is right up till he says a man should be able to have multiple women.  Just because you can do something doesn’t mean it’s RIGHT.  God didn’t want men to have multiple wives. He wanted us to care for one of them for life.  “A man cleaves from his family and him and his wife become one” Multiple wives has never been what God wanted.,rightSide178,1,2022-12-25T16:49:11Z

"The pregnancy point is key here. Why did adultery laws only punish cheating women and the man she was sleeping with while cheating? Paternity fraud.  A man marrying multiple women causes no parental identification issues, so society can reasonably expect that those men and women are responsible for the resulting children. A man cheating with a single woman causes no parental identification issues. A woman cheating with a single man confuses paternity and steals resources from another man.  All of that said, promiscuity in general has similar problems because it creates the same effect as a woman cheating: parental uncertainty. It also destroys marriage in practice because men know, on a subconscious level, that the woman isn’t worth investing time and effort into. After all, why should he when so many other men enjoyed the pleasure of being with her for less cost?  If women would ever find supporting a man attractive, that last point might change, but currently, men are the breadwinners for most long term family building relationships. They are the ones paying an active cost that could continue even if there is a divorce (i.e. child support and alimony payments). Women as a whole do no take such risks, so they likely don’t understand how unattractive their promiscuity really is in relation to finding a long term commitment. They think promiscuity should be either neutral or even attractive because they are thinking of promiscuous men who had to work hard for their promiscuity. As contradictory as it sounds, women will often look for “preselected” men (i.e. in relationships) because another women has effectively vouched for that man’s value (similar to employers only seeking people with jobs). This is honestly a foolish approach built on the arrogant idea that they can do better at keeping that man than the current women. After all this, women still complain that men won’t commit.  Regarding the other points in the video, Bill Burr said it best: “There are no feminists in a house fire.”",Tom Forge,0,2022-12-25T16:07:51Z
"I’m so glad I brought my daughter up to stay mindful of femininity, keep her femininity, and steer well clear of dumb feminists! If you want to become instantly unattractive to men (and I watched this in HD at my Uni) get on a stage or platform of a unisex audience and proudly announce you’re a feminist! Then watch as every man looks at the floor, or whispers to his mate…’she’s on the “no approach list”’  Forget it… Oh Pearly, who cancelled you? A man or a woman… 😅",Scal51,0,2022-12-25T16:07:36Z

"The introduction of state on the podcast is a GrandMaster move by Pearl & only God can stop me from tuning to the live show tonight (from London) - I cannot wait! From this snippet, Tate has already debunked the egregious fallacy that is feminism by disseminating every pathetic, futile point Danelva - the atypical closeted modern feminist- threw at him. They use the feminism as a manipulative weapon to indoctrinate and pollute society through their outrage at the fabrication of the “patriarchy”, despite the fact not a single woman, at least in the western world, is remotely suffering by it. Of course they’re too far in theI delusion to have any critical thinking ability to see the bigger picture that their movement is a load of hypocrisy. When shit hits the melting point, they’ll engulf themselves in cowardice and hide behind a man to fix it and I’m glad Tate hit the nail on the head with that.

"Man is created to praise, reverence, and serve God our Lord, and by this means to save his soul. And the other things on the face of the earth are created for man and that they may help him in prosecuting the end for which he is created. From this it follows that man is to use them as much as they help him on to his end, and ought to rid himself of them so far as they hinder him as to it. For this it is necessary to make ourselves indifferent to all created things in all that is allowed to the choice of our free will and is not prohibited to it; so that, on our part, we want not health rather than sickness, riches rather than poverty,honor rather than dishonor, long rather than short life, and so in all the rest; desiring and choosing only what is most conducive for us to the end for which we are created..",Raverraver9999,0,2022-12-25T15:46:52Z

I’m currently in the US army and let me tell you. My MOS has been available to only males in past history up until about 6 yrs ago. The unfortunate few females who decided to enter my field of work in combat arms hate their lives and they’re stuck with it. They always need assistance doing things a male could do on his own and are essentially there just for us to babysit. I feel bad for these individuals and the new female soldiers coming in this specific MOS that was traditionally only available to males due to these feminists living comfy lives with with their creature comforts from their big homes telling ignorant girls to go and do the man’s work to prove something aligning with their opinions.,Jace350,0,2022-12-25T15:40:46Z

"Women don't understand, you have to earn respect. It cannot be given  There's nothing more ridiculous, than a woman saying, you must respect me.  It just shows that she hasn't done anything respectable, and then is nagging trying to get respect.  Very few women deserve respect.  Most women are atrocious human beings.  Most women can't even maintain female friendships.  Men can call up their best friend from first grade because they're still friends.  So women, who bad mouth their peer group, can't maintain genuine friendships, for any amount of time, use men for their personal gain without giving them anything in return. These are examples of terrible people.  Why would you ever respect terrible people that don't even respect themselves?",Justin Bozeman,0,2022-12-25T15:20:58Z

I agree with him BUT I also believe I don't deserve to be cheated on. I think it's not ok. It's not just pregnancies that multiple partners risk. I don't want STDS. I also think if he makes another family he can't give his 100% to his kids and kids NEED a good dad. I watch my kids turn into monsters every fire season. Like clock work without the influence of a father. There is a reason it takes 2 to make a baby because 2 are required for them to grow up healthy and if he has multiple families he simply is not physically able to give the kids what they need no matter how much money he has. Money does not make you a good father. The world is in decline because the absence of fathers in the home.

This is gonna be fire 🔥 honestly I didn’t know tate knew this much about female nature and male nature. I only really liked him for the broader matrix talks. When he got canceled that’s when I knew there was something wrong because I knew he was being misunderstood and misrepresented on this new short clip short reel TLDR (too long didn’t read) gold fish culture. I knew he was being put out of context with chopped up and paste clips. And I knew he knew a litle bit about human nature but I’d go to him for matrix videos. I’d go to rollo tomassi for male female dynamics.

"It's not that anyone necessarily wants that. However, the piece of the puzzle you're missing is that only the very top percentages of men actually have the options to do that. Why? Because women are generally hypergamous by nature, in other words they want the best of the best. Whether that's physically/looks, money / future money (ambition) or status. You have to become something and be successful in comparison to the greater majority for women to want you as a man. So while you might be right that women don't want that, they DO want the top men. Clearly.
So it generally comes with the territory. You're not the only woman to ever want him, if he's a top man in society. And it's of no surprise to anyone that men are very much driven by s*x with beautiful women. So the chances of such a successful man not having been s*xually with other women before you with how ""s*xually liberated"" women are nowadays...? Miniscule. Specially if you keep in mind that men often only start reaching their peak between 35-50 in terms of stability, (true) confidence and resources. That's a good 20+ years post-puberty.🙈",Max Power,1,2022-12-25T15:19:49Z

"As much as I agree with alot of what Tate says, I can't take him serious for converting to islam. You don't just go from being a high intellectual atheist your whole life, to all of a sudden becoming a deeply devoted and faithful islamist. He's obviously good at articulating his point, most likely he's putting on this act, because after getting canceled in the west, he had to find an area, where he could not be sued, and thus get away with his views and being able to screw as many women/wifes as possible, without getting heat for it.  This guy didn't just by random find muhammed after getting cancelled, he's making calculated chess moves to further his own interests. So whenever he brings in islam into the topics, I would recommend taking what he says with a grain of salt.",knekker1,0,2022-12-25T14:42:05Z
"@knekker1  right idiot. First of all Scandinavia isn't a country its a region consisting of several countries including the likes of Norway. one particular feature of that set of countries is the extremely low poverty rate... for example Norway between 2018-2022, has a poverty rate of between 0.3-0.6% ... this is unheard of in any other region of the world. As I already told u the biggest factor for corruption and crime scientifically proven is socioeconomics.

that's why when Italy and Greece's economies plummeted and the gap between rich and poor widened they got worse and became worse than some Arab countries and even some African countries...this is a proven correlation.

there no deflections here u brought up a point about millionaire in dubai and then got schooled lol u brought up a corruption scale and then got schooled 🤣

"@knekker1  there are several Arab countries that higher than many European counties in the scale which is astonishing given the level of poverty and disparity between rich and pow in most Arab counties compared to those others

the biggest indicator of corruption and crime is socioeconomics. hence why pre the financial crashes Greece was one of the best for corruption on the scale and afterwards it now one of the worst. these studies have been done we know the factors that lead to corruption and crime. its literally ignorance and prejudice coming from your mouth :)

"@Vk Deen I never mentioned USA in this whole discussion, there are numerious christian countries that are less than ideal, but on average the west tend to do be doing a lot better than the Islamic countries. I think USA is a third world country in some aspect similar to the whole middle east is in terms of corruption and life quality and safety. I've only mentioned the west and more specifically Scandinavia in this debate, It's you who keep bringing up USA. This just shows how desperate you are to win the argument, but you have no interest in comparing the middle east with Scandinavia because it would make this debate really difficult for you.

Scandinavia is in the top 4 of the least corrupt countries in the world, whereas UAE sits far below at 24, on the tipping point of being on the wrong red colorspectrum side of the corruption color scale, with Qatar at spot 31. And for the remaining islamic countries the color only goes from aweful to wtf lol?...

that is the exact reason they rejected your passport there no naivety about it... its literally factual. are there abuses that sometimes go on? absolutely  like I said the majority of the contractors were foreign and they didn't lift a finger to help the workers... big company problem.

One thing top g exaggerated on was women at war. He's not all correct on this one as there are exceptions in which women do also fight the war. But although they do and you might find few random women at the front lines what he should have mentioned is that : If we are truly equal why there is no women only armies that are deployed and expected to achieve the same goals as men armies. They are mixed in together with men at a small ratio probably more than 1 women to 100 men ( just guessing ).,sharky1950,0,2022-12-25T14:12:45Z

"This guy's god allows men to rape ,have sex with children,  prostitution  and have multiple wives.  I wonder how much respect he would have for his father if he saw him do all these things.  He may have money,  power , and  influence . But so did  Kevin  Samuels,  and he is dead without any hope if he didn't  repent and turn to Jesus for the forgiveness of his sins.  Tate will go the same way  and all those like him if they don’t  repent.  Tates mouth is a sewer ,full of foul language, and disrespect, making himself  worse than  the prostitutes  he thinks are vile. He says he can get a different woman whenever  he wants  and is proud of  that fact. But would he want someone to treat his daughter the way he treats  the daughters  of other men. Hypocrite is what Jesus would call such a person.  One day, this world will vanish, and the bottom line will be, is not how smart a person is but how we treat oneanother, and the Love we show to the GOD who created us all. Read the book of Hosea and know that God is only judge of what a persons value is, not Tate and his false god.  These women should repent also for their  sins.",Factotum 1,1,2022-12-25T14:10:43Z

Some sleep with men just cuz they're trying to lock one down. But they don't understand men work differently a real man when they're asked if they are going to put real interest in her he will tell her the truth. Real men will not fuck around with the relationship they will be very forthcoming and straightforward. Real men don't have time for games real men don't care for nonsense real men will not hide the truth because they know it is what it is. Women need to learn how to ask the right questions. And women need to stop being so judgmental and maybe look at a man's lifestyle if he's partying and out to party that is not a man that is wanting a real relationship. Yes there are times where men that want to real relationship go to a club but that's because they're normally With Friends or they're by their selfs lonely looking for someone. And they might not even know who they're looking for and you wouldn't know if he's the one for you unless you came up to ask him because he is obviously depressed sitting there by himself drinking.,BoB BoBy,0,2022-12-25T14:01:39Z

"I don't always disagree with Andrew, but cheating is equally haram/impermissible in Islam for both men and women. When something goes against Islam, that's where I draw the line. Women are precious and are to be respected. We honor women through marriage and good treatment, certainly not cheating. Saying you love a woman then gaslighting her to believe that cheating on her is okay, and she should stay for your status is very immoral my brother. However, if you are a man of status, and you are able to be with more than one woman, Islam clearly states that you can marry up to four wives if you treat them equally. Again, equally, no side chicks or any of that degeneracy. Also, telling your wife to shut up and make a sandwich is extremely rude, and I'm concerned that some of the women laughed at that (in the trailer). Goes to show how little respect they give women in certain areas of the world. A real man is someone whose wife respects him and obeys him out of love and respect not because he intimidates her. True masculinity is something far greater than this. Finally, I write this for myself first and then for men and women of the world to explain what Islam really is as this man is not an ambassador of Islam (don't get me wrong though, I love him as a brother in Islam and he almost always says correct things).

You can't bring up the stupid argument that single mothers are trash when you as a husband start to treat them less respectfully or cheat around and give the woman a reason she is no longer happy and wants to leave cause as a father you have a responsibility too to secure this family, it's the stability it's safety. If the woman also not brings in her part after the child is here (letting herself go, not looking for the household, not looking that the husband has his quietness etc ok there is a problem but even then it is your fucking duty to talk with each other cause as soon you have a child you have brought life in this world it is a duty of both of you.",Martin Winter,0,2022-12-25T13:47:58Z

"3:32 Sex outside of marriage is punishable in Islam. Having multiple wives in Islam is not like a jackpot for men, it rather comes with an immense responsibility towards Women. Its offers a solution to Men's desire for more women, and also the problem of Widows and Single mothers.

"They don't need to defend feminism with their lives, thats absurd. Women won with their logic, arguments and high education, this trend started in Age of Enlightenment
 where females would get education. But they are willing to defend freedom with their lives. Greek women are well known heroines in our history. Women will go to battle where is needed. Check the Heroines of Greek Revolution 1821, some women even commit mass suicide to avoid to become sex slaves of the Turks, others fought beside men and aided them, and others used all their money to make warships and lead them to war. Some educated women would reach rich women in Europe and asked for money and weapons. 
Some times the greatest battles are won from logic, education, and intellectual wit. The Romans credited this way the Greeks, ""we won with our arms, they won with their culture"".",Princess Charis Phoenix,1,2023-01-27T10:04:33Z

When a big dog goes to the dark park occasionally a little dog confronts it barking relentlessly and the big dog walks away.   The little dog thinks they have established dominance but the reality is the big dog could crush its skull any time it wanted but doesn’t want to waste its energy over something trivial.

"Every woman wants a man who is desired by other women. Women literally compete for that man ignoring all the other men who genuinely love them, treat them respectively and wanna dedicate their lives for them. Think of your time in school or college. Girls would gossip about some ""bad boy"" and desire him. Shitting on the girl that dated him. Girls always ended up with the guy they complained about the most. This is why you see men on toppest mountain have multiple women because he is literally the best of the best, so they don't compete cause there is no room for competition at all, so they either go down and settle or just accept the faith and they do accept their place as ""one of the women"" cause their is no room for competition. But competition is still there not for the king but they fight for the successor. Internal stuggles, politics to ensure their son i.e prince is sitting on the throne by hook or crook, daughter marries into a kingdom where she is 1st wife and her offspring becomes the next king by royal rule of elder son should be sitting on the throne. Look at history, most internal feuds have always been queens wanting power for their kids or their relatives. Most of them were not even loyal they cheated when the king was out expanding his kingdom and that is applicable to today's world as well. Look around it is true.",Gaurav Patil,5,2022-12-25T13:21:31Z

Everytime I encounter this guy he is shouting and showboating while his shit spewing mouth voices his obvious hatred and contempt doctrine towards women. It took a few chance meetings and now I realize his attempt to desperately sell such self grandizing idealism is more about convincing himself it's true than anyone else in the room!

Usually YT comments are little more than superficial one-liners, so I find your thoughts interesting and worthy of some deeper thought. 🙂",Max Power,1,2022-12-25T15:25:42Z
"@Max Power 
I think you have spent a great deal of time considering his message. Congrats. It just isnt my cup of tea per say. You express yourelf well and I think Andrew Tate has a big cheerleader on his side. 
I don't know his history or background and the information he states is purely conjecture so it can't be verified, plus it doesnt really matter to me. I hardly ever respond to videos or comments so it was interesting to hear your position. I wish you and yours a fabulous Holiday! Take care!",Shannon Beyers,1,2022-12-25T15:11:23Z
"@Shannon Beyers It doesn't sound like if we disagree all that much. I'm not religious, so that stuff is fine but it doesn't hold any particular weight to me. And even you said that he sure puts on a spectacle. That's exactly what he does and it's a big part of why he has become so well-known. He masterfully intertwines pretty obvious stuff and facts with sarcasm, irony, and the more over-the-top sides of his online persona. That includes the yelling and I'm the most confident and alpha person in the building! It makes you feel things. It makes you think about and question the status quo.

A very calm, plain and academic conversation would get 100 views and ultimately have no impact on the world. Whether you like it or not, the way he does things has clearly been a massive success. People clearly respond to it. It grabs people's attention. It has given millions of disenfranchised young men - mainly - a role model to look up to and motivate them to level up and keep going even if their current lives aren't what they would've liked currently. If it takes some crude jokes, an over-the-top online persona and some yelling, then that's a fairly small price to pay for so much good on a global scale.

Finally, I just wanted to point out that while I'm not religious, the main religions have been around for a long time now. They've survived, unlike many that have been left behind along the way. So regardless of any divine powers, they seem to contain some kind of good-practice for a long-term thriving society. Rather than completely shun it all, maybe it would be worth considering what those things are?
Same thing with what you called a call ""Caveman"" stuff. I don't hear Tate or anyone really pushing us to a primitive caveman existence. I honestly think that's a case of you maybe getting so hung up on how he says things that you manage to miss what he's actually saying. His point is that biology is real, and our biological needs and proclivities are a big part of what drives us to want what we want and choose what we choose. Whether we're aware of it or not. No amount of technological advancement or academic studying will undo that anytime soon. It is part of who and what we are. It's part of how we made it to here.

In both cases, the behaviors that have been successful long-term have survived and thrived. The choices that have been successful long-term have survived and thrived. That's why society has been shaped the way it has. I believe that a big part of that is that different people have different strength and weaknesses. That doesn't mean that one person's value as a human is any greater or lesser than the next person, or that people don't deserve basic respect, only that we have different purposes and that our greatest contribution to society is in different areas. As a greater society, we are much stronger together pulling in the same direction, than with everyone off on their own little self-absorbed island running their own race. It's what makes us different that makes us compliment each other so well. Only when we acknowledge that and accept our place in the greater picture can we be happy and be the best version of ourselves. Only then can our society thrive at its fullest capacity.",Max Power,1,2022-12-25T14:46:05Z
"@Max Power 
Howdy! Merry Christmas! I'm one of those people that just cant absorb what's being said if it's being shouted and hurled across the room at me. The spectacle overrides the message. It's funny how technology  has evolved the status of virtually any and all related components in life as we know it but this Tate guy is always talking about Capt. Caveman stuff. Humanity is so completely flawed so it's obvious no God is present or waiting for us to give us guidance and his doctrines absurdity confirms that to me. Absent any real existence of Divinity culture always embraces the silver tongue devil and the carnival show that comes with it. Another false prophet capitalizing on man's need to believe we are special and exceptional within a Universe so vast and infinite that we must try and put a context to our existence. I think man has and will continue to dominate over the minions of the world including women just by his nature of physical strength and stature. I think it's that simple and that easy. Humanity is abhorred really! I think he is a direct reflection of man's basic notion that women are to be subserviant property just as intended ( as he mentions his reverance to a Divinity). No God explains all of humanity...believing in one explains nothing! He's another sideline carnival barker making his pitch to make a living just as the rest of us have to have income.

That's another reason to marry a low body count woman.

Women are more sexually charged than men, they are the real sex maniacs and you are correct in that they are more selective. They all select the same small group of guys!  The top 5% of guys are getting all the sex during this sick ""hookup"" culture women have started.

"remember these are the guys we're suppose to submit to , the guys who wont defend a school for their  daughters and sisters . which proves u are on ur own as a woman independence from these untrustworthy snakes    is the only way",lidia gizaw,1,2022-12-25T12:51:48Z
"You completely missed the point. In the West, those schools, rights, liberties are being defended. Your independence is literally guaranteed by men in the West and that's why in the West armed extremist groups like the Taliban do not exist on that level, and Islamic terrorists in Europe cannot simply get up and do what they want and impose Sharia. If they ever tried it, it certainly wouldn't the likes of you, vile feminist like you, that would do or even say anything to stop those men. But online you seem to have all the smoke for men who've actually done nothing to you in the meantime. 

You go, girl. 

In the West it is the men, that you perfidiously refer to as snakes, and not women that have and continue to defend your freedoms as women. If you can jump on a man created computer and freely type using alphabet you probably learned in a man built school from the safety of your man built home, it's because of those anonymous men that you disrespect with each breath you take. 

His whole point was that in countries like Afghanistan this is not being done. And, please, no man anywhere owes you his life and a woman that talks like you is worthy of no man's sacrifice, so take it easy. The only snake I see here is you for not realising that the only reason that you can talk the way you talk is because of men, since I don't imagine you'd talk to the Taliban with the same venom. Angry and ungrateful women like you are literally a joke and worthless to any man on any level. I sincerely hope no man ever has to deal with you in any capacity.",Vusyumani Sahelien,0,2022-12-27T15:55:07Z

When literally I’ll smack the shit out of any of you for your sheer weakness and ignorance. None of you are leaders or will ever lead anyone in the right direction. You know why because to start y’all first gotta stop being followers and Tate dick riders. That guy doesn’t even want you in the same table with his brother and his cousin and y’all kiss his ass with out even having an ounce of improvement in your own lives.

She was literally speaking facts about what men want out of a woman. She’s even with a dude shorter than her, and still gives him the utmost respect for his masculinity. No one is gas lighting you, and if you thought that was a gaslighting attempt, it was a piss poor one. Anyway, there’s definitely a stick up your ass if you think a woman wanting to smile for her man, and bringing peace to his life and wanting to be classically feminine in the presence of her masculinity man is cringe.

He's shorter but burly and mean looking and makes me feel feminine and protected. His neck and wrists are like 3 times thicker than mine. In return for his protection, i feel it's important that i be sweet and smile for my warrior. He gets mad if i wear pants and flats, so for me, I'm often in short floaty full skirts and heels.

@Aaron Sandman  of course if he's proven guilty I would be disgusted and he deserves what ever comes his way but it seems you have so much hate in your heart that your willing to just believe that this is all true.  You are right for once.  I am not a troll and I don't do this often but there are more people like me who are tired of people having there good name ruined over false accusations by so many who are quick to guilt without a trial.  We will see if these charges stick and If they don't I'm sure your view will be that he bought his way out and I'm gonna say that it is another witch hunt for the powers that be to silence men who speak up and tell the truth about what is going on in society,Nathan Cline,0,2022-12-30T08:13:24Z

"Andrew left out a very important piece of the 4 wives vs 4 husbands argument.  A man, needs to be able to provide for his 4 wives and the children they produce. Thus he is of value.  What does a woman provide to/for her 4 husbands?  Generally speaking. A woman who has 4 men willing to submit to such a stupid arrangement are low value. But even still. She gets protection and provision from each. She gets variety of sexual partners. She gets people to give her attention..what do they actually get?  In America. This actually happened. An unattractive overweight woman had a husband and 3 boyfriends living in one house. She would actually rotate out the husband from their marital bed. With the boyfriends. Anyway. She got pregnant. And it happened to be the husband's. But, she expected the other 3 men to also look after the child.  Eventually one was arrested for child abuse as he would beat the baby. And if you watch the video, none of the men actually looked happy. Save for the weasel looking cuck husband.",Ben Thomas,2,2022-12-25T12:22:07Z

"“Men don’t want to change, they’re not accountable for themselves” oh the irony",jester,211,2022-12-25T08:41:39Z
"@Hamza Siddiqui Again, projection.

But it's more complicated when it comes to insecurity. Women get insecure all the time about all kinds of things. Men get insecure about being able to protect their genetic investment.
Men get loyal in a way, or to a degree, that women don't. Once they have bonded with a woman, they can become insecure if they get the feeling that the woman isn't as loyal as they are. They had planned to raise a son, pass on his hunting skills, and has some expectation that the son will take care of him and the mother as they get older. I'm speaking of evolutionary motivation, instincts. The other strategy is the sowing of wild oats. The young man may invest very little in a bunch of possible offspring, but usually when he gets older he will adjust to the other strategy. Women fall in the middle of those two strategies. She knows for sure the baby is hers, but she is incapacitated while pregnant and until the kid can be helpful, so she needs a man to feed and protect her and her child, but she needs to be psychologically able to quickly shift to another man, because part of her man's job is to put his life at risk for her, and occasionally the man loses. She needs to be alert for any signs of weakness, illness or loss of interest, so she can shift gears ASAP.
This is a really crude/low resolution explanation, and if there's one word that describes everything human it is 'exceptions', but I hope you can see source of the three psychological patterns. I'm not accusing, forgiving, or even judging people here, a lot of this is subconscious.",GordieGii,0,2022-12-25T14:48:12Z
